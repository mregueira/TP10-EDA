Will this notable demographic trend force us to change our image of the older adults and regard them as a more vital force in society? Joseph F. Coughlin, director of the MIT AgeLab, which is part of the Center for Transportation and Logistics, hopes so. Coughlin’s new book, “The Longevity Economy,” published this week by PublicAffairs, makes a pointed call for companies and policymakers to expand their ideas about what seniors can and want to do in life. &lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; sat down with Coughlin to talk about innovation for an aging population. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Your new book, “The Longevity Economy,” makes the case that we’ve developed misleading social narratives about aging. What do you mean by that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the oldest and most powerful innovations in humankind is the story: It shapes how we view the world, it powers causality, it helps us make sense of what we do. We have this story, which itself is only about 100 years old, that birthdays predict everything, that at a certain age you retire, hold back from life, and don’t do certain things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than continuing to believe this old story, I say, let’s find out how technology is going to extend our ability to stay mobile and connected — to activate the talent and knowledge of our growing older population. Transportation technologies, for instance, are only as good as where you can go, what things there are to do — and that means not just going to the doctor’s office and grocery store, but visiting friends and grandchildren, working if you want to, or volunteering with passion and purpose. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longevity economy is not just about the money to be made, but the reality that after about age 65, we run out of narrative. We may walk a child down the aisle or go on a cruise ship or play a bad round of golf, but after 65, society says, “You’re done.” That’s the story we’re told, but in reality, at 65, you’re very likely to make it not just to 85, but further. That’s 8,000 days! That’s roughly the same amount of time an MIT undergraduate spends from birth to graduation. Our challenge is to ensure quality of life, for a century of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways the Baby Boomers are largely to blame, and I’m one of them myself — one of those 76 million people who seemed like they’d be young forever. They trained companies, researchers, and designers to believe the 18-35 age range is the only one worth worrying about in order to get consumers hooked for life on their products and ideas. Well, guess what? The Boomers are now inheriting what they created, at the very moment when we need to think of new products, technologies, services, and experiences for the later age ranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, more specifically, what are the problems with our current products for the elderly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever you start a research program around aging, it always devolves into falls, pills, and reminder systems. The instinct is always to “solve” the problem of aging. And that’s a worthy and necessary goal for a part of the population, part of the time. But it’s incomplete: Older adults are people first, not a puzzle to be solved. It is not until very recently that we’ve begun to think beyond medicalized technologies that beep, buzz, and badger us, to consider things that may connect you with a family member or a more extended social network. Think about the internet of things: We have houses that are aware of our well-being, systems making sure we haven’t fallen, and toilets talking about what we ate. How about connecting some of those things to social networks or friends and family, so that a grandchild wants to know my cookie recipe, not just whether or not I took my beta blocker?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take personal emergency response systems, such as those necklaces with an emergency call button. As a technology, they are well-meaning, virtuous, cheap, and easy-to-use, but the penetration rate is just 2 percent among the 65-plus. In the U.K. with the National Health Service paying for them, the penetration rate is still a low 16 percent. What we’re selling is an image no one wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the MIT AgeLab, we’ve learned to ask questions beyond “what’s good for you” to understand the new motivations in old age. We [should think] about fun, about learning for a lifetime. One thing about the study of longevity that MIT is profoundly qualified for is that it’s interdiciplinary. You need to have technologists work with artists to create style in products for the aging, and they have to work with the business people to get it out of the lab and into your living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; And yet there is big money to be made from retirement communities and lifestyles which, in many ways, reinforce the idea that the elderly are not active, as you observe in a chapter of your book that is set in Florida. So what’s wrong with this segment of the market for the aging?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I probably will never be allowed back in Florida, as much as I love the state. But even if you have money and health, our outdated narrative says, “You’ve retired now. It’s time to leave. And you can have as much fun as you want, because you earned it. But still, you’re cut off.” Essentially you’re being told you’ve earned the reward of being segregated from the rest of society. On a moral level I don’t think that’s appropriate. I do, however, completely understand why people double down on the idea of retirement and move to age-segregated communities. It’s because there’s no narrative competition in how we think about later life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s already changing, and practically speaking, it couldn’t come soon enough. &amp;nbsp;Those people we are sending away in retirement are taking away what one of my colleagues terms “lost knowledge.” For example, computer systems we’re trying to protect are written in languages you only learned if you were in school in the 1970s. Or, in major companies and government, people who have the contacts with clients and best knowledge are walking out the door. That’s not just bad politics and policy, that’s bad economics. And we find when people don’t wake up with a purpose, it’s not good for their health. It’s not good for individuals, and it’s not good for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re entering a moment when all that can change. That vision of retiring and no longer participating is often not fair to all that talent. What I’m saying is the longevity economy is about activating the full life span — so we can live not just longer, but better.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/MIT-3Q-Longevity.jpg" type="image" width="948" height="632"><media:description type="plain">Joseph F.

It may soon be able to send out an SOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have created sensors that can be printed onto plant leaves and reveal when the plants are experiencing a water shortage. This kind of technology could not only save neglected houseplants but, more importantly, give farmers an early warning when their crops are in danger, says Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and the senior author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This appears to be the earliest indicator of drought that we have for agricultural applications,” Strano says. “It’s hard to get this information any other way. You can put sensors into the soil, or you can do satellite imaging and mapping, but you never really know what a particular plant is detecting as the water potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strano has already begun working with a large agricultural producer to develop these sensors for use on crops, and he believes that the technology could also be useful to gardeners and urban farmers. It may also help researchers develop new ways to engineer drought-resistant plants, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volodymyr Koman, an MIT postdoc, is the lead author of the paper, which appears in the Nov. 8 online edition of the journal &lt;em&gt;Lab on a Chip&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/fileermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/3-questions-joseph-coughlin-innovation-aging-population-1108</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The populations of many developed countries are aging markedly, due to a suite of medical, social, and economic changes.

(Image: Volodymyr Koman/MIT Chemical Engineering)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Printable sensors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When soil dries out, plants slow down their growth, reduce photosynthetic activity, and suffer damage to their tissues. Some plants begin to wilt, but others show no visible signs of trouble until they have already experienced significant harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new MIT sensor takes advantage of plants’ stomata — small pores in the surface of a leaf that allow water to evaporate. As water evaporates from the leaf, water pressure in the plant falls, allowing it to draw water up from the soil through a process called transpiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant biologists know that stomata open when exposed to light and close in darkness, but the dynamics of this opening and closing have been little studied because there hasn’t been a good way to directly measure them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People already knew that stomata respond to light, to carbon dioxide concentration, to drought, but now we have been able to monitor it continuously,” Koman says. “Previous methods were unable to produce this kind of information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create their sensor, the MIT researchers used an ink made of carbon nanotubes — tiny hollow tubes of carbon that conduct electricity — dissolved in an organic compound called sodium dodecyl sulfate, which does not damage the stomata. This ink can be printed across a pore to create an electronic circuit. When the pore is closed, the circuit is intact and the current can be measured by connecting the circuit to a device called a multimeter. When the pore opens, the circuit is broken and the current stops flowing, allowing the researchers to measure, very precisely, when a single pore is open or closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By measuring this opening and closing over a few days, under normal and dry conditions, the researchers found that they can detect, within two days, when a plant is experiencing water stress. They found that it takes stomata about seven minutes to open after light exposure and 53 minutes to close when darkness falls, but these responses change during dry conditions. When the plants are deprived of water, the researchers found that stomata take an average of 25 minutes to open, while the amount of time for the stomata to close falls to 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is exciting because it opens up the possibility of directly printing electronics onto plant life for long-term monitoring of plant physiological responses to environmental factors, such as drought,” says Michael McAlpine, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drought alert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, the researchers tested the sensors on a plant called the peace lily, which they chose in part because it has large stomata. To apply the ink to the leaves, the researchers created a printing mold with a microfluidic channel. When the mold is placed on a leaf, ink flowing through the channel is deposited onto the leaf surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team is now working on a new way to apply the electronic circuits by simply placing a sticker on the leaf surface. In addition to large-scale agricultural producers, gardeners and urban farmers may be interested in such a device, the researchers propose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could have big implications for farming, especially with climate change, where you will have water shortages and changes in environmental temperatures,” Koman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related work, Strano’s lab is exploring the possibility of creating arrays of these sensors that could be used to detect light and capture images, much like a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Swiss National Science Foundation, and Singapore’s Agency for Science, Research, and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/MIT-Drough-Sensor-1.jpg" type="image" width="948" height="632"><media:description type="plain">Artist's impression of the sensor comprised of conductive ink printed across a stoma with two micropillars. </media:description><media:credit>Image: Betsy Skrip</media:credit></media:content><story:tags>Research, Chemical engineering, Plants, Agriculture, Nanoscience and nanotechnology, School of Engineering, Department of Energy (DoE)</story:tags>  </item>  <item>    <title>A new way to mix oil and water</title>    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-way-mix-oil-and-water-1108</link>    <description>Condensation-based method developed at MIT could create stable nanoscale emulsions.</description>     <pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 04:59:59 -0500</pubDate> <dc:creator>David L. Chandler | MIT News Office</dc:creator> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-way-mix-oil-and-water-1108</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reluctance of oil and water to mix together and stay that way is so well-known that it has become a cliché for describing any two things that do not go together well. Now, a new finding from researchers at MIT might turn that expression on its head, providing a way to get the two substances to mix and remain stable for long periods — no shaking required. The process may find applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and processed foods, among other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new process involves cooling a bath of oil containing a small amount of a surfactant (a soap-like substance), and then letting water vapor from the surrounding air condense onto the oil surface. Experiments have shown that this can produce tiny, uniform water droplets on the surface that then sink into the oil, and their size can be controlled by adjusting the proportion of surfactant. The findings, by MIT graduate student Ingrid Guha, former postdoc Sushant Anand, and associate professor Kripa Varanasi, are reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has ever used salad dressing knows, no matter how vigorously the mixture gets shaken, the oil and the vinegar (a water-based solution) will separate within minutes. But for many uses, including new drug-delivery systems and food-processing methods, it’s important to be able to get oil in water (or water in oil) to form tiny droplets — only a few hundred nanometers across, too small to see with the naked eye — and to have them stay tiny rather than coalescing into larger droplets and eventually separating from the other liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, in industrial processes these emulsions are made by either mechanically shaking the mix or using sound waves to set up intense vibrations within the liquid, a process called sonicating. But both of these processes “require a lot of energy,” Varanasi says, “and the finer the drops, the more energy it takes.” By contrast, “our approach is very energy inexpensive,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key to overcoming that separation is to have really small, nanoscale droplets,” Guha explains. “When the drops are small, gravity can’t overcome them,” and they can remain suspended indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new process, the team set up a reservoir of oil with an added surfactant that can bind to both oil and water molecules. They placed this inside a chamber with very humid air and then cooled the oil. Like a glass of cold water on a hot summer day, the colder surface causes the water vapor to precipitate. The condensing water then forms droplets at the surface that spread through the oil-surfactant mixture, and the sizes of these droplets are quite uniform, the team found. “If you get the chemistry just right, you can get just the right dispersion,” Guha says. By adjusting the proportion of surfactant in the oil, the droplet sizes can be well-controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiments, the team produced nanoscale emulsions that remained stable over periods of several months, compared to the few minutes that it takes for the same mixture of oil and water to separate without the added surfactant. “The droplets stay so small that they’re hard to see even under a microscope,” Guha says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the shaking or sonicating methods, which take the large, separate masses of oil and water and gradually get them to break down into smaller drops — a “top down” approach — the condensation method starts off right away with the tiny droplets condensing out from the vapor, which the researchers call a bottom-up approach. “By cloaking the freshly condensed nanoscale water droplets with oil, we are taking advantage of the inherent nature of phase-change and spreading phenomena,” Varanasi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bottom-up approach of creating nanoscale emulsions is highly scalable owing to the simplicity of the process,” Anand says. “We have uncovered many new phenomena during this work. We have found how the presence of surfactant can change the oil and water interactions under such conditions, promoting oil spreading on water droplets and stabilizing them at the nanoscale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team says that the approach should work with a variety of oils and \BC\B3&o\A0surfactants, and now that the process has been identified, their findings “provide a kind of design guideline for someone to use” for a particular kind of application, Varanasi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It\E2\80 and closing of plant stomata.

As water evaporates from the leaf, water pressure in the plant falls, allowing it to draw water up from the soil through a process called transpiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant biologists know that stomata open when exposed to light and close in darkness, but the dynamics of this opening and closing have been little studied because there hasn’t been a good way to directly measure them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People already knew that stomata respond to light, to carbon dioxide concentration, to drought, but now we have been able to monitor it continuously,” Koman says. “Previous methods were unable to produce this kind of information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create their sensor, the MIT researchers used an ink made of carbon nanotubes — tiny hollow tubes of carbon that conduct electricity — dissolved in an organic compound called sodium dodecyl sulfate, which does not damage the stomata. This ink can be printed across a pore to create an electronic circuit. When the pore is closed, the circuit is intact and the current can be measured by connecting the circuit to a device called a multimeter. When the pore opens, the circuit is broken and the current stops flowing, allowing the researchers to measure, very precisely, when a single pore is open or closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By measuring this opening and closing over a few days, under normal and dry conditions, the researchers found that they can detect, within two days, when a plant is experiencing water stress. They found that it takes stomata about seven minutes to open after light exposure and 53 minutes to close when darkness falls, but these responses change during dry conditions. When the plants are deprived of water, the researchers found that stomata take an average of 25 minutes to open, while the amount of time for the stomata to close falls to 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is exciting because it opens up the possibility of directly printing electronics onto plant life for long-term monitoring of plant physiological responses to environmental factors, such as drought,” says Michael McAlpine, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drought alert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, the researchers tested the sensors on a plant called the peace lily, which they chose in part because it has large stomata. To apply the ink to the leaves, the researchers created a printing mold with a microfluidic channel. When the mold is placed on a leaf, ink flowing through the channel is deposited onto the leaf surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team is now working on a new way to apply the electronic circuits by simply placing a sticker on the leaf surface. In addition to large-scale agricultural producers, gardeners and urban farmers may be interested in such a device, the researchers propose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could have big implications for farming, especially with climate change, where you will have water shortages and changes in environmental temperatures,” Koman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related work, Strano’s lab is exploring the possibility of creating arrays of these sensors that could be used to detect light and capture images, much like a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Swiss National Science Foundation, and Singapore’s Agency for Science, Research, and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/MIT-Drough-Sensor-1.jpg" type="image" width="948" height="632"><media:description type="plain">Artist's impression of the sensor comprised of conductive ink printed across a stoma with two micropillars. </media:description><media:credit>Image: Betsy Skrip</media:credit></media:content><story:tags>Research, Chemical engineering, Plants, Agriculture, Nanoscience and nanotechnology, School of Engineering, Department of Energy (DoE)</story:tags>  </item>  <item>    <title>A new way to mix oil and water</title>    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-way-mix-oil-and-water-1108</link>    <description>Condensation-based method developed at MIT could create stable nanoscale emulsions.</description>     <pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 04:59:59 -0500</pubDate> <dc:creator>David L.

Now, a new finding from researchers at MIT might turn that expression on its head, providing a way to get the two substances to mix and remain stable for long periods — no shaking required. The process may find applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and processed foods, among other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new process involves cooling a bath of oil containing a small amount of a surfactant (a soap-like substance), and then letting water vapor from the surrounding air condense onto the oil surface. Experiments have shown that this can produce tiny, uniform water droplets on the surface that then sink into the oil, and their size can be controlled by adjusting the proportion of surfactant. The findings, by MIT graduate student Ingrid Guha, former postdoc Sushant Anand, and associate professor Kripa Varanasi, are reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has ever used salad dressing knows, no matter how vigorously the mixture gets shaken, the oil and the vinegar (a water-based solution) will separate within minutes. But for many uses, including new drug-delivery systems and food-processing methods, it’s important to be able to get oil in water (or water in oil) to form tiny droplets — only a few hundred nanometers across, too small to see with the naked eye — and to have them stay tiny rather than coalescing into larger droplets and eventually separating from the other liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, in industrial processes these emulsions are made by either mechanically shaking the mix or using sound waves to set up intense vibrations within the liquid, a process called sonicating. But both of these processes “require a lot of energy,” Varanasi says, “and the finer the drops, the more energy it takes.” By contrast, “our approach is very energy inexpensive,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key to overcoming that separation is to have really small, nanoscale droplets,” Guha explains. “When the drops are small, gravity can’t overcome them,” and they can remain suspended indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new process, the team set up a reservoir of oil with an added surfactant that can bind to both oil and water molecules. They placed this inside a chamber with very humid air and then cooled the oil. Like a glass of cold water on a hot summer day, the colder surface causes the water vapor to precipitate. The condensing water then forms droplets at the surface that spread through the oil-surfactant mixture, and the sizes of these droplets are quite uniform, the team found. “If you get the chemistry just right, you can get just the right dispersion,” Guha says. By adjusting the proportion of surfactant in the oil, the droplet sizes can be well-controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiments, the team produced nanoscale emulsions that remained stable over periods of several months, compared to the few minutes that it takes for the same mixture of oil and water to separate without the added surfactant. “The droplets stay so small that they’re hard to see even under a microscope,” Guha says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the shaking or sonicating methods, which take the large, separate masses of oil and water and gradually get them to break down into smaller drops — a “top down” approach — the condensation method starts off right away with the tiny droplets condensing out from the vapor, which the researchers call a bottom-up approach. “By cloaking the freshly condensed nanoscale water droplets with oil, we are taking advantage of the inherent nature of phase-change and spreading phenomena,” Varanasi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bottom-up approach of creating nanoscale emulsions is highly scalable owing to the simplicity of the process,” Anand says. “We have uncovered many new phenomena during this work. We have found how the presence of surfactant can change the oil and water interactions under such conditions, promoting oil spreading on water droplets and stabilizing them at the nanoscale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team says that the approach should work with a variety of oils and \BC\B3&o\A0\99s such an important thing,” he says, because “foods and pharmaceuticals always have an expiration date,” and often that has to do with the instability of the emulsions in them. The experiments used a particular surfactant that is widely used, but many other varieties are available, including some that are approved for food-grade products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Guha says, “we envision that you could use multiple liquids and make much more complex emulsions.” And besides being used in food, cosmetics, and drugs, the method could have other applications, such as in the oil and gas industry, where fluids such as the drilling “muds” sent down wells are also emulsions, Varanasi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the MIT Energy Initiative, the National Science Foundation, and a Society in Science fellowship. Anand, the co-author who was a postdoc at MIT, is now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/MIT-NanoEmulsion-A1.jpg" type="image" width="948" height="632"><media:description type="plain">Graduate student Ingrid Guha holds a jar containing a clear liquid that looks like water to the naked eye, but it’s actually an emulsion of oil and water at the nanoscale. </media:description><media:credit>Image: Melanie Gonick, M to produce this kind of information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create their sensor, the MIT researchers used an ink made of carbon nanotubes — tiny hollow tubes of carbon that conduct electricity — dissolved in an organic compound called sodium dodecyl sulfate, which does not damage the stomata.

The devices could find uses in cables to connect computing devices, or in diagnostic and monitoring systems that could be attached to the skin or implanted in the body, flexing easily with the natural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which involve the use of a specialized kind of glass called chalcogenide, are described in two papers by MIT Associate Professor Juejun Hu and more than a dozen others at MIT, the University of Central Florida, and universities in China and France. The paper is slated for publication soon in &lt;em&gt;Light: Science and Applications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;000058FBp&gt;Hu, who is the Merton C. Flemings Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, says that many people are interested in the possibility of optical technologies that can stretch and bend, especially for applications such as skin-mounted monitoring devices that could directly sense optical signals. Such devices might, for example, simultaneously detect heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and even blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photonics devices process light beams directly, using systems of LEDs, lenses, and mirrors fabricated with the same kinds of processes used to manufacture electronic microchips. Using light beams rather than a flow of electrons can have advantages for many applications; if the original data is light-based, for example, optical processing avoids the need for a conversion process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most current photonics devices are fabricated from rigid materials on rigid substrates, Hu says, and thus have an “inherent mismatch” for applications that “should be soft like human skin.” But most soft materials, including most polymers, have a low refractive index, which leads to a poor ability to confine a light beam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of using such flexible materials, Hu and his team took a novel approach: They formed the stiff material — in this case a thin layer of a type of glass called chalcogenide — into a spring-like coil. Just as steel can be made to stretch and bend when formed into a spring, the architecture of this glass coil allows it to stretch and bend freely while maintaining its desirable optical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You end up with something as flexible as rubber, that can bend and stretch, and still has a high refractive index and is very transparent,” Hu says. Tests have shown that such spring-like configurations, made directly on a polymer substrate, can undergo thousands of stretching cycles with no detectable degradation in their optical performance. The team produced a variety of photonic components, interconnected by the flexible, spring-like waveguides, all in an epoxy resin matrix, which was made stiffer near the optical components and more flexible around the waveguides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other kinds of stretchable photonics have been made by embedding nanorods of a stiffer material in a polymer base, but those require extra manufacturing steps and are not compatible with existing photonic systems, Hu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such flexible, stretchable photonic circuits could also be useful for applications where the devices need to conform to the uneven surfaces of some other material, such as in strain gauges. Optics technology is very sensitive to strain, according to Hu, and could detect deformations of less than one-hundredth of 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is still in early stages; Hu’s team has demonstrated only single devices at a time thus far. “For it to be useful, we have to demonstrate all the components integrated on a single device,” he says. Work is ongoing to develop the technology to that point so that it could be commercially applied, which Hu says could take another two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another paper published last week in &lt;em&gt;Nature Photonics&lt;/em&gt;, Hu and his collaborators have also developed a new way of integrating layers of photonics, made of chalcogenide glass and two-dimensional materials such as graphene, with conventional semiconductor photonic circuitry. Existing methods for integrating such materials require them to be made on one surface and then peeled off and transferred to the semiconductor wafer, which adds significant complexity to the process. Instead, the new process allows the layers to be fabricated directly on the semiconductor surface, at room temperature, allowing for simplified fabrication and more precise alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process can also make use of the chalcogenide material as a “passivation layer,” to protect 2-D materials from degradation caused by ambient moisture, and as a way to control the optoelectronic characteristics of 2-D materials. The method is generic and could be extended to other emerging 2-D materials besides graphene, to expand and expedite their integration with photonic circuitry, Hu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also included MIT Professor Jing Kong, MIT postdocs Lan Li and Hongtao Lin, and others at the University of Texas, Xiamen University and Chongqing University in China, Universite Paris-Sud in France, the University of Southampton in the UK, and the University of Central Florida.

Just as steel can be made to stretch and bend when formed into a spring, the architecture of this glass coil allows it to stretch and bend freely while maintaining its desirable optical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You end up with something as flexible as rubber, that can bend and stretch, and still has a high refractive index and is very transparent,” Hu says. Tests have shown that such spring-like configurations, made directly on a polymer substrate, can undergo thousands of stretching cycles with no detectable degradation in their optical performance. The team produced a variety of photonic components, interconnected by the flexible, spring-like waveguides, all in an epoxy resin matrix, which was made stiffer near the optical components and more flexible around the waveguides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other kinds of stretchable photonics have been made by embedding nanorods of a stiffer material in a polymer base, but those require extra manufacturing steps and are not compatible with existing photonic systems, Hu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such flexible, stretchable photonic circuits could also be useful for applications where the devices need to conform to the uneven surfaces of some other material, such as in strain gauges. Optics technology is very sensitive to strain, according to Hu, and could detect deformations of less than one-hundredth of 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is still in early stages; Hu’s team has demonstrated only single devices at a time thus far. “For it to be useful, we have to demonstrate all the components integrated on a single device,” he says. Work is ongoing to develop the technology to that point so that it could be commercially applied, which Hu says could take another two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another paper published last week in &lt;em&gt;Nature Photonics&lt;/em&gt;, Hu and his collaborators have also developed a new way of integrating layers of photonics, made of chalcogenide glass and two-dimensional materials such as graphene, with conventional semiconductor photonic circuitry. Existing methods for integrating such materials require them to be made on one surface and then peeled off and transferred to the semiconductor wafer, which adds significant complexity to the process. Instead, the new process allows the layers to be fabricated directly on the semiconductor surface, at room temperature, allowing for simplified fabrication and more precise alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process can also make use of the chalcogenide material as a “passivation layer,” to protect 2-D materials from degradation caused by ambient moisture, and as a way to control the optoelectronic characteristics of 2-D materials. The method is generic and could be extended to other emerging 2-D materials besides graphene, to expand and expedite their integration with photonic circuitry, Hu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also included MIT Professor Jing Kong, MIT postdocs Lan Li and Hongtao Lin, and others at the University of Texas, Xiamen University and Chongqing University in China, Universite Paris-Sud in France, the University of Southampton in the UK, and the University of Central Florida.

She directs the &lt;a href=&quot;http://urbanrisklab.org/&quot;&gt;Urban Risk Lab,&lt;/a&gt; where her research focuses on disaster-resilient design. Before coming to MIT in 2012, Mazereeuw taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and the University of Toronto. She has experience in professional practice with architectural offices in the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States. Her research in Japan inspired a pioneering approach to “preemptive design,” in which she shows how urban public space (e.g., plazas, parks, and schoolyards) can be reconfigured as safe havens that have emergency response infrastructure and supplies to anticipate and mitigate the effects of natural disasters. Mazereeuw contributes to post-disaster reconstruction through the design of evacuation structures and strategies that link emergency shelter with resilient infrastructure and communication networks, most notably in Haiti and Indonesia. She holds a BA from Wesleyan Universiu and his team took a novel approach: They formed the stiff material — in this case a thin layer of a type of glass called chalcogenide — into a spring-like coil.

Computer scientists, economists, and industry experts spoke about a range of topics that included legal policy, technical challenges, and assistive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his opening remarks, MIT President L. Rafael Reif noted the important societal gains that could stem from AI, such as economic growth, higher living standards, longer life spans and less disease. However, he also described the fear that many Americans face related to automation and job loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seventy-two&amp;nbsp;percent of Americans say they feel worried about a future [in which] robots and computers can do many human jobs,” said Reif. “It&#039;s clear to almost everyone that deep change is happening. For most people it&#039;s not clear how to respond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, a common theme throughout the event was the potential physical and mental benefits of automating monotonous work. Schmidt expressed his belief that AI will not only make workers more productive, but help spur a future of ubiquitous personal assistants, saving time and helping people lead happier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The presumption is that existing jobs are lost, and you can’t imagine the jobs that are created,” he said. “[But] AI is replacing tasks.&amp;nbsp;There is a surplus of jobs and not enough people to fill them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, many technical issues still remain. CSAIL researcher and autonomous-driving expert John Leonard discussed some of the challenges underlying what he calls the “great space race of the 21st&amp;nbsp;century.” He spoke about the concept of “parallel autonomy,” where humans are are still in control of the car, but the vehicle onboard computer will step in if the driver is about to make a dangerous move. He is among several MIT researchers who are working with Toyota to use this approach with self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity expert &lt;a href=&quot;https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/team/daniel-weitzner/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Daniel Weitzner&lt;/a&gt; spoke on a panel that examined a delicate practical question about AI: who’s at fault when it makes a mistake? Weitzner spoke about the limits of deep learning systems that are high-performing, but whose decisions still aren’t fully understood by the humans that created them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are learning ways to trick these systems, making them downright harmful to individuals and more difficult to figure out who is at fault,” said Weitzner. “I imagine we could create a static mechanism that conforms to a set of rules and regulations that we can lay out, and build to those rules.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sessions included a discussion about job training with Rusty Justice, whose company Bit Source “turns coal miners into data miners.” Kai-Fu Lee, an influential former Google China executive who is now CEO of Sinovation Ventures, spoke about the state of AI in China, and predicted that AI would be able to do half all job tasks in China in the next 10 to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit builds off other major MIT AI initiatives, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/ibm-mit-joint-research-watson-artificial-intelligence-lab-0907&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;new lab with IBM&lt;/a&gt; and “SystemsThatLearn@CSAIL,”&amp;nbsp;which focuses on democratizing AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of the AI advances that have been made, most speakers at the summit agreed that there’s still ample room for inventing better and smarter systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always said that human-level intelligence is 20 years off,” said MIT AI Professor Patrick Winston. “Eventually we’ll be right.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/AI%20and%20the%20Future%20of%20Work_%2020_preview_0.jpeg" type="image" width="2048" height="1365"><media:description type="plain">MIT Professor Daniela Rus (right), director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, speaks with Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt. </media:description><media:credit>Photo: Jason Dorfman/MIT CSAIL </media:credit></media:content><story:tags>Special events and guest speakers, Artificial intelligence, Jobs, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Computer science and technology, Technology and society, Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science (eecs), Autonomous vehicles, Industry, Data, School of Engineering, Sloan School of Management, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E), Business and management</story:tags>  </item>  <item>    <title>Fighting a giant foe at a tiny scale</title>    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-chemical-engineering-paula-hammond-fighting-cancer-with-nanomaterials-1107</link>    <description>Professor Paula Hammond uses nanoscale biomaterials to craft anti-cancer treatments tiny enough to get through the bloodstream and enter tumors.</description>     <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:55:00 -0500</pubDate> <dc:creator>Julie Barr | MIT Alumni Association</dc:creator> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-chemical-engineering-paula-hammond-fighting-cancer-with-nanomaterials-1107</guid><content:en\BC\B3&o\A0coded>&lt;p&gt;Paula Hammond’s research focuses on using nanoscale biomaterials to attack cancer, which&amp;nbsp;she calls “a supervillain with incredible superpowers.” Using targeted nanoparticles, she is attempti humanitarianism, and charity; human rights, democratization, and postconflict transition processes; race, gender, and culture; and religion and healing.

He is among several MIT researchers who are working with Toyota to use this approach with self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity expert &lt;a href=&quot;https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/team/daniel-weitzner/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Daniel Weitzner&lt;/a&gt; spoke on a panel that examined a delicate practical question about AI: who’s at fault when it makes a mistake? Weitzner spoke about the limits of deep learning systems that are high-performing, but whose decisions still aren’t fully understood by the humans that created them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are learning ways to trick these systems, making them downright harmful to individuals and more difficult to figure out who is at fault,” said Weitzner. “I imagine we could create a static mechanism that conforms to a set of rules and regulations that we can lay out, and build to those rules.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sessions included a discussion about job training with Rusty Justice, whose company Bit Source “turns coal miners into data miners.” Kai-Fu Lee, an influential former Google China executive who is now CEO of Sinovation Ventures, spoke about the state of AI in China, and predicted that AI would be able to do half all job tasks in China in the next 10 to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit builds off other major MIT AI initiatives, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/ibm-mit-joint-research-watson-artificial-intelligence-lab-0907&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;new lab with IBM&lt;/a&gt; and “SystemsThatLearn@CSAIL,”&amp;nbsp;which focuses on democratizing AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of the AI advances that have been made, most speakers at the summit agreed that there’s still ample room for inventing better and smarter systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always said that human-level intelligence is 20 years off,” said MIT AI Professor Patrick Winston. “Eventually we’ll be right.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/AI%20and%20the%20Future%20of%20Work_%2020_preview_0.jpeg" type="image" width="2048" height="1365"><media:description type="plain">MIT Professor Daniela Rus (right), director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, speaks with Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt. </media:description><media:credit>Photo: Jason Dorfman/MIT CSAIL </media:credit></media:content><story:tags>Special events and guest speakers, Artificial intelligence, Jobs, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Computer science and technology, Technology and society, Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science (eecs), Autonomous vehicles, Industry, Data, School of Engineering, Sloan School of Management, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E), Business and management</story:tags>  </item>  <item>    <title>Fighting a giant foe at a tiny scale</title>    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-chemical-engineering-paula-hammond-fighting-cancer-with-nanomaterials-1107</link>    <description>Professor Paula Hammond uses nanoscale biomaterials to craft anti-cancer treatments tiny enough to get through the bloodstream and enter tumors.</description>     <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:55:00 -0500</pubDate> <dc:creator>Julie Barr | MIT Alumni Association</dc:creator> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-chemical-engineering-paula-hammond-fighting-cancer-with-nanomaterials-1107</guid><content:en\BC\B3&o\A0ng to turn off the natural defenses of mutant genes and deliver a deadly punch to the cancer cell. Her work will soon be translated into clinical practice through partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, entrepreneurial partners, and startups in health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long interested in reading and the arts, Hammond&amp;nbsp;’84, PhD ’93&amp;nbsp;considered writing children’s novels before she decided to study chemical engineering as an undergraduate at MIT. After working at Motorola for two years, she earned her master’s degree at Georgia Tech and then returned to MIT for a new PhD program in polymer science. In 1995 Hammond joined the MIT faculty, where she is now the David H. Koch Professor of Engineering and head of the Department of Chemical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her 2003 sabbatical, she began to focus on biomaterials. As someone entering that field in mid-career, she says, “I brought a new perspective, with a materials design approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, she has merged design and polymer engineering to create breakthroughs in drug delivery technology. By layering negatively and positively charged molecules, Hammond and her team can create coated meshes and wound dressings that gradually release combinations of an antibiotic and a growth factor to help the wound heal, support bone regeneration, or control the scarring that can result from a burn or tissue injury.&lt;/p&gt;search group called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-enabled/overview/&quot;&gt;Space Enabled&lt;/a&gt;,” with the mission of advancing justice and development using designs enabled by space. Her work aims to help developing communities and nations adopt satellite and other technologies for earth and environmental observation. A key focus is the design of satellites that collect data that serves societal needs — for example, data on crops, water, and weather, specifically in Africa and Asia. Wood has presented her research through many scholarly publications, conferences, and invited talks across Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, and North America. She has received numerous grants, fellowships, and awards. Wood holds a BS, an MS, and a PhD from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/mit-school-architecture-planning-faculty-promotions-2017.jpg" type="image" width="996" height="596"><media:description type="plain">First row (l-r): Erica James, Christoph Reinhart, Ana Miljački, Janelle Knox-Hayes, Hugh Herr.

Computer scientists, economists, and industry experts spoke about a range of topics that included legal policy, technical challenges, and assistive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his opening remarks, MIT President L. Rafael Reif noted the important societal gains that could stem from AI, such as economic growth, higher living standards, longer life spans and less disease. However, he also described the fear that many Americans face related to automation and job loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seventy-two&amp;nbsp;percent of Americans say they feel worried about a future [in which] robots and computers can do many human jobs,” said Reif. “It&#039;s clear to almost everyone that deep change is happening. For most people it&#039;s not clear how to respond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, a common theme throughout the event was the potential physical and mental benefits of automating monotonous work. Schmidt expressed his belief that AI will not only make workers more productive, but help spur a future of ubiquitous personal assistants, saving time and helping people lead happier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The presumption is that existing jobs are lost, and you can’t imagine the jobs that are created,” he said. “[But] AI is replacing tasks.&amp;nbsp;There is a surplus of jobs and not enough people to fill them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, many technical issues still remain.

By taking a nanoparticle core loaded with drugs that kill cancer cells, surrounding that core with layers that contain silencing RNA to turn off the genes that promote cancer survival, and adding a final outer layer that helps the nanoparticle reach the tumor, it is possible to target drug-resistant cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During&amp;nbsp;her 2015 presentation for the live show &quot;TED Talks: Science and Wonder,&quot; Hammond said that, using molecular engineering, “we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream.

Featuring an update on the status of the department and presentations on new research developments from four distinguished faculty members, the event highlighted the global contributions of CEE research and provided a glimpse into the imminent impact to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing better than having alumni come back to MIT and see the light and sparkle in their eyes. It reminds me of the time when they were students; some of the alumni here tonight I met when they were students,” said Markus Buehler, the McAfee Professor of Engineering and head of CEE, during the opening remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buehler gave an overview of the department, including recent additions to the faculty and&amp;nbsp;updates on the undergraduate and graduate programs&amp;nbsp;and community initiatives. He also spoke about the department’s the unique fieldwork programs: Traveling Research Environmental eXperiences (TREX) and Materials in Art, Archaeology and Architecture (ONE-MA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), which take students to Hawaii for environmental research and Italy for infrastructure and materials research, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In CEE it’s important to see the world as our classroom, and TREX and ONE-MA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bring our stude00004000nts out into the field to get firsthand research experience,” Buehler said. “We hope to build more of these kinds of activities, because there’s nothing better than actually seeing and touching and experiencing what infrastructure and the environment really looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a networking hour, four faculty members gave brief overviews of their current and ongoing research, and fielded questions about their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor &lt;a href=&quot;http://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/oral-buyukozturk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oral Buyukozturk&lt;/a&gt; began his research presentation by highlighting examples of major structural failures that have occurred around the world. He explained how his research seeks to study and prevent such occurrences through innovative, sustainable materials and an understanding of the mechanics and design of structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustainability is a driving factor for Buyukozturk’s research. The production of concrete contributes up to six percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, he said, and one of the goals of his research is to design materials that have low embodied energy and emit lower carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be done; the Romans did it more than 2,000 years ago. But they did not use the concrete we are using today. They used local materials;&amp;nbsp;they looked at the local materials to try to come up with the best solution,” Buyukozturk said. “The Romans were able to generate structures that last 2,000 years, but that’s basically through trial and error. Now we’re in the age of science, and we need to go through a more scientific approach.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this new approach, Buyukozturk and his group start by analyzing the atoms and molecules that make up different cementitious-based construction materials for use in infrastructures. In his overview of recent research in his group, Buyukozturk spoke of the creation of a computer model that simulates the behavior of atomistic level building blocks under a variety of conditions and related this to the macroscopic mechanical behavior showing how the strength develops in concrete materials. The study is expected to open a new era in engineering new materials and structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Buyukozturk showed examples of dynamic identification and quantification of structural systems including bridges from remote video camera measurements using motion magnification, a new development and innovation of his group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also gave an introduction to a newly launched large scale project related to the City of Groningen in the Netherlands. For this project, Buyukozturk and his team are studying why earthquakes continue to occur after local oil drilling ceased.&amp;nbsp;The ultimate goal of the project is&amp;nbsp;to predict potential damage to local infrastructure from these earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institute Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/sallie-w-penny-chisholm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sallie &quot;Penny&quot;&amp;nbsp;Chisholm&lt;/a&gt;, most well-known for her role in discovering &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt;, the smallest, most abundant photosynthetic cell, spoke about the significance of the cell on the global carbon cycle. She explained that half of photosynthesis on earth occurs in oceans and bodies of water, and &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt;, the smallest of all phytoplankton, is collectively responsible for 10 percent of that, making it a significant player in the global carbon cycle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt; was discovered in the mid-1980s, Chisholm and her lab have made a number of critical discoveries about the cell. While each cell has on average 200 genes, they each contain flexible genes that vary from cell to cell based on the environment. It is estimated that, collectively, there are more than 80,000 different genes in &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus &lt;/em&gt;in the world’s oceans, four times the genetic information in a human being. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think of the ocean as dissolved information,” Chisholm said. “There’s this information in microbes and it’s moving around, so one question is, how it is it moving around?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying the flexible genes, Chisholm’s lab found that the genes can be identified as coming from different species. The lab analyzed vesicles on the &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt; cell and found that they contain DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids, and thus could be one of the ways in which DNA is being mixed around and moving from species to species and contributing to the flexible gene pool, Chisholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chisholm also spoke about recent developments in her lab, including research from Rogier Braakman, a postdoc&amp;nbsp;in her lab, and that of Professor Mick Follows of CEE and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. Braakman found that the evolution of &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt; could provide insight into the evolution of more complex marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following her presentation, Chisholm was asked about &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus’ &lt;/em&gt;response to pollution in oceans, to which she explained that it is found in relatively pristine open ocean ecosystems and is particularly sensitive to trace metals, making it difficult to bring the cell into the lab and recreate its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Assistant Professor\BC\B3&o\A0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/tal-cohen/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tal Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in nonlinear solid mechanics and material instabilities, gave an outline of her roff the genes that promote cancer survival, and adding a final outer layer that helps the nanoparticle reach the tumor, it is possible to target drug-resistant cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During&amp;nbsp;her 2015 presentation for the live show &quot;TED Talks: Science and Wonder,&quot; Hammond said that, using molecular engineering, “we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream.

The study is expected to open a new era in engineering new materials and structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Buyukozturk showed examples of dynamic identification and quantification of structural systems including bridges from remote video camera measurements using motion magnification, a new development and innovation of his group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also gave an introduction to a newly launched large scale project related to the City of Groningen in the Netherlands. For this project, Buyukozturk and his team are studying why earthquakes continue to occur after local oil drilling ceased.&amp;nbsp;The ultimate goal of the project is&amp;nbsp;to predict potential damage to local infrastructure from these earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institute Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/sallie-w-penny-chisholm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sallie &quot;Penny&quot;&amp;nbsp;Chisholm&lt;/a&gt;, most well-known for her role in discovering &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt;, the smallest, most abundant photosynthetic cell, spoke about the significance of the cell on the global carbon cycle. She explained that half of photosynthesis on earth occurs in oceans and bodies of water, and &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt;, the smallest of all phytoplankton, is collectively responsible for 10 percent of that, making it a significant player in the global carbon cycle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt; was discovered in the mid-1980s, Chisholm and her lab have made a number of critical discoveries about the cell. While each cell has on average 200 genes, they each contain flexible genes that vary from cell to cell based on the environment. It is estimated that, collectively, there are more than 80,000 different genes in &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus &lt;/em&gt;in the world’s oceans, four times the genetic information in a human being. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think of the ocean as dissolved information,” Chisholm said. “There’s this information in microbes and it’s moving around, so one question is, how it is it moving around?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying the flexible genes, Chisholm’s lab found that the genes can be identified as coming from different species. The lab analyzed vesicles on the &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt; cell and found that they contain DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids, and thus could be one of the ways in which DNA is being mixed around and moving from species to species and contributing to the flexible gene pool, Chisholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chisholm also spoke about recent developments in her lab, including research from Rogier Braakman, a postdoc&amp;nbsp;in her lab, and that of Professor Mick Follows of CEE and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. Braakman found that the evolution of &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/em&gt; could provide insight into the evolution of more complex marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following her presentation, Chisholm was asked about &lt;em&gt;Prochlorococcus’ &lt;/em&gt;response to pollution in oceans, to which she explained that it is found in relatively pristine open ocean ecosystems and is particularly sensitive to trace metals, making it difficult to bring the cell into the lab and recreate its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Assistant Professor\BC\B3&o\A0esearch and her newly established Nonlinear Solid Mechanics Group. Cohen began her presentation by talking about the trend towards the use of highly deformable materials in engineering, such as flexible phones and wearable sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems in recent years that our ability to perform very precise experiments, computations, and fabrication techniques has advanced tremendously, but we still have a ways to go in understanding and making sense of all of the data that we are producing,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her talk, entitled “Mechanics of Squishy Things,” Cohen described her interest in understanding how material instabilities form and how materials grow. She discussed how understanding surface growth, a natural process seen in nature, can potentially be translated to engineering applications. Material growth is only one of the focuses of her research group; her group also looks at material instabilities and extreme dynamic loading conditions, and how these three concepts interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen concluded her presentation with an overview of the classes she is teaching this semester, including 1.058 (Structural Dynamics) and 1.101 (Civil and Environmental Engineering Design I).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a super exciting experience because [in 1.101] we’re essentially teaching students to invent. We’re putting them in a space where they think about what inspires them in civil and environmental engineering, and we take them through a design process to come to a final product. We try to go outside and to look at what’s going on around campus and how can we improve things on campus using engineering tools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, H.M. King Bhumibol Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/dennis-mclaughlin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dennis McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; spoke to the group about sustainable options for food security. He stressed the challenge of meeting global food demand with a rising population, especially in areas of East Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got interested in food security primarily through its connection with water, because I’m a hydrologist. Most of the water that humans are involved with goes to agriculture,” McLaughlin said at the beginning of his talk. “We have a tendency to take food security for granted and to assume that since our needs are met now they will be met in the future. And yet things are changing very rapidly as the food and resource needs of people in developing countries increase dramatically. Many of the changes are not felt so much by people in this room, who can import all the food they need, but are important for people who are not as well-off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his presentation, McLaughlin touched upon the primary options for increased food production: expanding cropland;&amp;nbsp;increasing yield through techniques such as irrigation, genetic modifications, and precision agriculture;&amp;nbsp;and better allocation of existing resources. He noted that cropland expansion and yield increases can have adverse environmental impacts that could restrict their effectiveness. More efficient allocation of land, water, and nutrients to both subsistence and cash crops could have great potential for meeting future food needs in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things you don’t want to do is expand agriculture in a way that is unsustainable because it stresses or depletes natural resources. It would be very useful to know the carrying capacity of agricultural systems from local to global scales. This is the maximum production we can expect with current technology and available resources. Improved understanding of resource limitations could help us identify the best places to grow particular crops and suggest strategies for more efficient and sustainable production,”&amp;nbsp;McLaughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLaughlin and his students are currently using optimization techniques to investigate more efficient and sustainable resource use in India, China, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The diverse research in CEE at MIT adapts to the world’s needs and seeks to find innovative solutions to these challenges,” Buehler said. “It is always great to reconnect with our alumni, to share our developments and achievements with them, to show them what our current students and researchers are doing to address major global challenges, and to gather useful feedback and new problems to collaborate on.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/Penny-Chisholm-Alumni-Research-Presentation-MIT-00.jpg" type="image" width="3000" height="2000"><media:description type="plain">Institute Professor Sallie "Penny" Chisholm presents her research on Prochlorococcus to the CEE community — including alumni — at the CEE New Research Reception. </media:description><media:credit>Photo: Alan Silfen</media:credit></media:content><story:tags>School of Engineering, Agriculture, Biological engineering, Civil and environmental engineering, EAPS, Food, Materials Science and Engineering, Faculty, Alumni/ae, Special events and guest speakers</story:tags>  </item>  <item>    <title>Strong current of energy runs through MIT</title>    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-energy-initiative-creates-robust-energy-research-community-1107</link>    <description>Research, education, and student activities help create a robust community focused on fueling the world&amp;#039;s future.</description>     <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:15:00 -0500</pubDate> <dc:creator>Kathryn M.

While some MIT researchers are modeling the impacts of policy on energy markets, others are experimenting with electrochemical forms of energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the robust energy community at MIT. Developed over the past 10 years with the guidance and support of the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) — and with roots extending back into the early days of the Institute — it has engaged more than 300 faculty members and spans more than 900 research projects across all five schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, MIT offers a multidisciplinary energy minor and myriad energy-related events and activities throughout the year. Together, these efforts ensure that students who arrive on campus with an interest in energy have free rein to pursue their ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities for students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MIT energy ecosystem is an incredible system, and it’s built from the ground up,” says Robert C. Armstrong, a professor of chemical engineering and the director of MITEI, which is overseen at the Institute level by Vice President for Research Maria Zuber. “It begins with extensive student involvement in energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunities begin the moment undergraduates arrive on campus, with a freshman pre-orientation program offered through MITEI that includes such hands-on activities as building motors and visiting the Institute’s nuclear research reactor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got accepted into the pre-orientation program and from there, I was just hooked. I learned about solar technology, wind technology, different types of alternative fuels, bio fuels, even wave power,” says graduate student Priyanka Chatterjee ’15, who minored in energy studies and majored in mechanical and ocean engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who choose the minor take a core set of subjects encompassing energy science, technology, and social science. Those interested in a deep dive into research can participate in the Energy Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), which provides full-time summer positions. UROP students are mentored by graduate students and postdocs, many of them members of the Society of Energy Fellows, who are also conducting their own energy research at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For extracurricular activities, students can join the MIT Energy Club, which is among the largest student-run organizations at MIT&amp;nbsp;with more than 5,000 members. They can also compete for the MIT Clean Energy Prize, a student competition that awards more than $200,000 each year for energy innovation. And there are&amp;nbsp;many other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tata Center for Technology and Design, now in its sixth year, extends MIT’s reach abroad. It&amp;nbsp;supports&amp;nbsp;65 graduate students every year who conduct research central to improving life in developing countries — including lowering costs of rural electrification and using solar energy in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students have other opportunities to conduct and share energy research internationally as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the years, MITEI has made it possible for several of the students I’ve advised to engage more directly in global energy and climate policy negotiations,” says Valerie Karplus, an assistant professor of global economics and management.&amp;nbsp;“In 2015, I joined them at the Paris climate conference, which was a tremendous educational and outreach experience for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holistic problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is important is to provide our students a holistic understanding of the energy challenges,” says MIT Associate Dean for Innovation Vladimir Bulović.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds Karplus:&amp;nbsp;“There’s been an evolution in thinking from ‘How do we build a better mousetrap?’ to ‘How do we bring about change in society at a system level?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of thinking is at the root of MIT’s multidisciplinary approach to addressing the global energy challenge — and it has been since MITEI was conceived and laun00006000ched by then-MIT President Susan Hockfield, a professor of neuroscience. While energy research has been part of the Institute since its founding (MIT’s first president, William Barton Rogers, famously collapsed and died after uttering the words “bituminous coal” at the 1882 commencement), the concerted effort to connect researchers across the five schools for collaborative projects is a more recent development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The objective of MITEI was really to solve the big energy problems, which we feel needs all of the schools’ and departments’ contributions,” says Ernest J. Moniz, a professor emeritus of physics and special advisor to MIT’s president. Moniz was the founding director of MITEI before serving as U.S. Secretary of Energy during President Obama’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hockfield says great technology by itself “can’t go anywhere without great policy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the economics, it’s the sociology, it’s the science and the engineering, it’s the architecture — it’s all of the pieces of MIT that had to come together if we were going to develop really impactful sustainable energy solutions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This multidisciplinary approach is evident in much of MIT’s energy research — notably the series of comprehensive studies MITEI has conducted on such topics as the future of solar energy, natural gas, the electric grid, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To make a better world, it’s essential that we figure out how to take what we’ve learned at MIT in energy and get that out into the world,” Armstrong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fostering collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MITEI’s eight low-carbon energy research centers — focused on a range of topics from materials design to solar generation to carbon capture and storage — similarly address challenges on multiple technology and policy fronts. These centers are a core component of MIT’s five-year Plan for Action on Climate Change, announced by President L. Rafael Reif in October 2015. The centers employ a strategy that has been fundamental to MIT’s energy work since the founding of MITEI: broad, sustained collaboration with stakeholders from industry, government, and the philanthropic and non-governmental organization communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s one thing to do research that’s interesting in a laboratory. It’s something very different to take that laboratory discovery into the world and deliver practical applications,” Hockfield says. “Our collaboration with industry allowed us to do that with a kind of alacrity that we could never have done on our own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, MITEI’s members have supported more than 160 energy-focused research projects,&amp;nbsp;representing $21.4 million in funding over the past nine years,&amp;nbsp;through the Seed Fund Program. Projects have led to follow-on federal and industry funding, startup companies, and pilot plants for solar desalinization systems in India and Gaza, among other outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has MIT’s energy community as a whole accomplished over the past decade? Hockfield says it’s raised the visibility of the world’s energy problems, contributed solutions — both technical and sociopolitical — and provided “an army of young people” to lead the way to a sustainable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t be prouder of what MIT has contributed,” she says. “We are in the midst of a reinvention of how we make energy and how we use energy. And we will develop sustainable energy practices for a larger population, a wealthier population, and a healthier planet.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/MIT-Energy-Past-Future-borders-01%20small.png" type="image" width="1500" height="1000"><media:description type="plain">Top row (l-r): Tata Center spinoff Khethworks develops affordable irrigation for the developing world; students discuss utility research in Washington; thin, lightweight solar cell developed by Professor Vladimir Bulović and team.

To mark the occasion, MITEI Director Robert Armstrong shared his thoughts on some of the MIT energy community’s achievements to date and highlighted promising projects that could lead to breakthroughs in the decades to come. He also discussed the characteristics and resources that have helped MIT develop a thriving center of energy research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What are some of the most significant research impacts the MIT energy community has made over the past decade?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;While the horizon for the majority of energy research we do here at MIT is generally at least several decades, some researchers have already been able to translate their research into technologies and start-up companies — many with early funding support from MITEI member companies and donors. A few examples include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;	&lt;li&gt;flexible, thin-film solar photovoltaics that can be printed on nearly any surface, developed by Professor Vladimir Bulović and colleagues;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Khethworks, a Tata Center for Technology and Design spinoff that is developing affordable irrigation for the developing world, co-founded by Katherine Taylor SM ’15, Victor Lesniewski, and PhD student Kevin Simon SM ’15;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;the solar-powered village-scale electrodialysis desalination system developed by PhD candidate Natasha Wright with Professor Amos Winter to provide clean drinking water to rural, off-grid villages in India — another project originating from the Tata Center;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;energy storage companies including Professor Yet-Ming Chiang’s 24M and Baseload Renewables, Professor Donald Sadoway’s Ambri, and FastCAP Systems, co-founded by Riccardo Signorelli PhD ’09 and Professor Joel Schindall;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Keystone Tower Systems, co-founded by Eric Smith ’01, SM ’07, Rosalind Takata ’00, SM ’06, and Professor Alexander Slocum, which has made it possible to fabricate wind turbine towers on location, making taller towers economically feasible&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Professor Kripa Varanisi’s research on engineering slippery surfaces to eliminate waste from manufacturing, which has led to a coating, LiquiGlide, and a start-up company, Dropwise — co-founded with Associate Provost Karen Gleason — that is developing coatings for power plants and industrial machinery to improve efficiency;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;the MIT-developed tokamak fusion research reactor, which set a record for plasma pressure and has paved the way for future fusion reactors; and&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;multidisciplinary studies such as \E2re than 5,000 members. They can also compete for the MIT Clean Energy Prize, a student competition that awards more than $200,000 each year for energy innovation. And there are&amp;nbsp;many other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tata Center for Technology and Design, now in its sixth year, extends MIT’s reach abroad. It&amp;nbsp;supports&amp;nbsp;65 graduate students every year who conduct research central to improving life in developing countries — including lowering costs of rural electrification and using solar energy in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students have other opportunities to conduct and share energy research internationally as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the years, MITEI has made it possible for several of the students I’ve advised to engage more directly in global energy and climate policy negotiations,” says Valerie Karplus, an assistant professor of global economics and management.&amp;nbsp;“In 2015, I joined them at the Paris climate conference, which was a tremendous educational and outreach experience for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holistic problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is important is to provide our students a holistic understanding of the energy challenges,” says MIT Associate Dean for Innovation Vladimir Bulović.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds Karplus:&amp;nbsp;“There’s been an evolution in thinking from ‘How do we build a better mousetrap?’ to ‘How do we bring about change in society at a system level?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of thinking is at the root of MIT’s multidisciplinary approach to addressing the global energy challenge — and it has been since MITEI was conceived and laun00006000ched by then-MIT President Susan Hockfield, a professor of neuroscience. While energy research has been part of the Institute since its founding (MIT’s first president, William Barton Rogers, famously collapsed and died after uttering the words “bituminous coal” at the 1882 commencement), the concerted effort to connect researchers across the five schools for collaborative projects is a more recent development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The objective of MITEI was really to solve the big energy problems, which we feel needs all of the schools’ and departments’ contributions,” says Ernest J. Moniz, a professor emeritus of physics and special advisor to MIT’s president. Moniz was the founding director of MITEI before serving as U.S. Secretary of Energy during President Obama’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hockfield says great technology by itself “can’t go anywhere without great policy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the economics, it’s the sociology, it’s the science and the engineering, it’s the architecture — it’s all of the pieces of MIT that had to come together if we were going to develop really impactful sustainable energy solutions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This multidisciplinary approach is evident in much of MIT’s energy research — notably the series of comprehensive studies MITEI has conducted on such topics as the future of solar energy, natural gas, the electric grid, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To make a better world, it’s essential that we figure out how to take what we’ve learned at MIT in energy and get that out into the world,” Armstrong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fostering collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MITEI’s eight low-carbon energy research centers — focused on a range of topics from materials design to solar generation to carbon capture and storage — similarly address challenges on multiple technology and policy fronts. These centers are a core component of MIT’s five-year Plan for Action on Climate Change, announced by President L. Rafael Reif in October 2015. The centers employ a strategy that has been fundamental to MIT’s energy work since the founding of MITEI: broad, sustained collaboration with stakeholders from industry, government, and the philanthropic and non-governmental organization communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s one thing to do research that’s interesting in a laboratory. It’s something very different to take that laboratory discovery into the world and deliver practical applications,” Hockfield says. “Our collaboration with industry allowed us to do that with a kind of alacrity that we could never have done on our own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, MITEI’s members have supported more than 160 energy-focused research projects,&amp;nbsp;representing $21.4 million in funding over the past nine years,&amp;nbsp;through the Seed Fund Program. Projects have led to follow-on federal and industry funding, startup companies, and pilot plants for solar desalinization systems in India and Gaza, among other outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has MIT’s energy community as a whole accomplished over the past decade? Hockfield says it’s raised the visibility of the world’s energy problems, contributed solutions — both technical and sociopolitical — and provided “an army of young people” to lead the way to a sustainable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t be prouder of what MIT has contributed,” she says. “We are in the midst of a reinvention of how we make energy and how we use energy. And we will develop sustainable energy practices for a larger population, a wealthier population, and a healthier planet.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/MIT-Energy-Past-Future-borders-01%20small.png" type="image" width="1500" height="1000"><media:description type="plain">Top row (l-r): Tata Center spinoff Khethworks develops affordable irrigation for the developing world; students discuss utility research in Washington; thin, lightweight solar cell developed by Professor Vladimir Bulović and team.

Among those that could have transformative implications for our energy system are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;	&lt;li&gt;next-generation solar technologies that lower manufacturing and system integration costs;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;long-term energy storage technologies to enable wind and solar deployment at scale;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;design and implementation of more robust electric grids for developing and developed nations — complemented by analysis and outreach that encourages innovative policies, regulations, and business models;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;energy- and climate-conscious urban planning to reduce intrinsic energy needs of new cities and neighborhoods, helping to mitigate climate change and increase resilience while making communities more livable — from materials like less carbon-intensive concrete to renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;insights into how transportation will evolve with developments in technology, fuel, infrastructure, policy, and consumer preference, currently being examined through MITEI’s &quot;Mobility of the Future&quot;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;study, expected to be published in 2019;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;new approaches to fusion that could begin to come to fruition, such as the small-scale reactor currently being designed at MIT;&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;development of advanced nanoscale materials engineered for high performance in devices — for example, quantum dot materials for solar photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and thermoelectric systems, and carbon nanotube electrodes for capacitors, batteries, and water desalination systems; and&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;li&gt;student and alumni research, technology, and policy development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we may not even know yet where our current or future students’ research will take them, or what our alumni may achieve in industry, government, or academic roles, I am confident that we’re preparing future innovators to meet energy and climate challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Why is MIT a compelling place for energy research?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; First and foremost, it’s the people here: the impressive expertise of the faculty and the intelligence and enthusiasm of the students, coupled with their eagerness to work across disciplines and to engage with industry and government on urgent energy challenges and issues. When the Energy Research Council was forming the MIT Energy Initiative, we thought that MIT had the right characteristics for cultivating an energy research and education community. As our researchers have developed projects with about 90 industry and public entities, we’ve seen an amazing degree and depth of collaboration across sectors, including many innovative outcomes that we couldn’t have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re increasingly working to translate completed research into commercializable ideas and companies. For example, the Tata Center for Technology and Design has interesting work going on to help their teams of graduate students and faculty deploy their projects at a larger scale. And we work with and draw on the knowledge of entities like the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship; having these kinds of resources right here on campus makes a huge difference in our ability to launch new business enterprises. The Engine is another prime illustration of a uniquely MIT-developed resource that is already having a positive impact: raising and investing patient capital to support promising projects within and outside of MIT, including energy ventures like Professor Yet-Ming Chiang’s Baseload Renewables or Professor Jeff Grossman’s Via Separations. MITEI’s Low-Carbon Energy Centers continue to convene researchers around specific energy technology areas to address climate change in areas from energy storage to advanced materials for energy applications, working with industry member companies — providing fertile ground for student projects and theses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our community also has a symbiotic relationship with the vibrant energy ecosystem here in Massachusetts and in the greater northeast region: Our Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program and Energy Studies Minor students have many local internships and careers to choose from, and companies and governments can tap our faculty expertise for speaking events, studies, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration’s five-year Plan for Action on Climate Change, support for using the campus as a living laboratory, and interest in exploring other ways of reducing our carbon footprint all generate opportunities for faculty, students, and staff. A few examples include the Office of Sustainability’s work with the Department of Facilities and MIT energy researchers to develop a greenhouse gas inventory, followed by the collaboration with Boston Medical Center and Post Office Square Redevelopment Corporation to develop the solar power purchase agreement for Summit Farms in North Carolina. The upgrades to MIT’s central utilities cogeneration plant also present learning opportunities for MIT and the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These and numerous other factors make MIT a grful sustainable energy solutions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This multidisciplinary approach is evident in much of MIT’s energy research — notably the series of comprehensive studies MITEI has conducted on such topics as the future of solar energy, natural gas, the electric grid, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To make a better world, it’s essential that we figure out how to take what we’ve learned at MIT in energy and get that out into the world,” Armstrong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fostering collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MITEI’s eight low-carbon energy research centers — focused on a range of topics from materials design to solar generation to carbon capture and storage — similarly address challenges on multiple technology and policy fronts.

It’s something very different to take that laboratory discovery into the world and deliver practical applications,” Hockfield says. “Our collaboration with industry allowed us to do that with a kind of alacrity that we could never have done on our own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, MITEI’s members have supported more than 160 energy-focused research projects,&amp;nbsp;representing $21.4 million in funding over the past nine years,&amp;nbsp;through the Seed Fund Program.

This particle had been a missing piece in the Standard Model of particle physics — a theory that describes all the known elementary particles and several major, fundamental forces governing the universe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember my physics teacher had a big poster of the Standard Model on the wall, with a question mark next to the top quark,” says Thaler, who recently was granted tenure as an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Physics. “When it was discovered, I remember him writing down the mass of that top quark where there used to be a question mark. I thought discoveries must happen all the time. Little did I know that particle physics is a decades-long, even centuries-long, endeavor to try to understand the fundamental nature of matter, and that I would eventually become a part of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler, a member of MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics and the Laboratory for Nuclear Science, is a self-described “pencil and paper, chalk and chalkboard” theorist, and works to derive theoretical insights to characterize the behavior of subatomic particles, and the fundamental forces that give structure to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s applying his theories to describe in greater detail the particles that are already known to the Standard Model, as well as predict the behavior of those beyond the Standard Model, which scientific theory cannot quite yet describe — namely, dark matter, which is thought to make up more than a quarter of the total mass-energy of the universe but has yet to be directly detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler is collaborating with experimental physicists on projects ranging from small tabletop detectors to massive collaborations such as the Large Hadron Collider, and applying his theoretical insights to interpret data from current experiments and guide the design of future experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research is always a balance between exploring what could, but might not, be there, and what must be there,” Thaler says. “Some would say everything should be beautiful and elegant and mathematical, and others would say the world is messy; you just have to study it. But at this boundary, it’s true some things are messy, and others are elegant, and living at that boundary is where I feel most comfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Subtleties at play”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler grew up in York, Maine, where his mother worked as a high school guidance counselor, and his father practiced family medicine. For high school, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy, where he quickly learned to think his way through tricky mathematical problems on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There wasn’t a textbook,” Thaler recalls. “You showed up the first day, they gave you a relatively thin stack of problems, and you went to class and had discussions but basically had to teach yourself. It was a very humanities-minded way of thinking of mathematics, which could also apply to physics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler went on to Brown University, where he pursued a degree in math and physics, doing research into the formation of black holes, while also taking courses in the humanities, from Japanese theatre, to the role of women in Islamic society, to race relations in Brazilian history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those classes helped me see that there is nuance, even in cases where you think things might be clear-cut,” Thaler says. “In physics, there are similar types of subtleties at play, where you can take different views on the same problem, and the answer comes from the full synthesis of those views. I try to take that approach in the physics research I do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To blow off some academic steam, Thaler picked up the electric bass as part of an eight-piece ’70s funk band, and put in late-night hours at the college radio station, playing jazz records under the pseudonym Lester, after legendary jazz saxophonist Lester Young. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would spin vinyl from 2 to 5:30 a.m. and then would have my 9 a.m. quantum mechanics class,” Thaler fondly recalls. “It was rough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Brown, he went on to graduate school at Harvard University, with the intention of studying string theory, which at the time was thought to uniquely explain the synthesis of gravity and quantum mechanics, in one unifying theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now I know that to be not quite the right story,” Thaler says. “The modern view of string theory is not that there’s one theory of everything, but many different theories that come out of string theory, and it’s a challenge to figure out which one of those corresponds to our universe, if any. So there’s not inevitability built in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his second-semester quantum field theory course, Thaler’s professor, who would become his thesis advisor, helped him redirect his focus toward another theory, not of everything, but of almost everything: the Standard Model of particle physics. It was in this class that Thaler began to see this model as something that could predict, with 100 percent certainty, that many things in the universe, such as the universal strength of gravity, would always be true. He also started to appreciate that there were limits to the Standard Model, and that there are some things about the universe, such as dark matter, that the theory so far has failed to describe in any organized, mathematical way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This represented a totally new, flexible way of thinking of quantum field theory where you really poked and prodded it from all angles and figured out where it really breaks down,” Thaler says. “So you have these twin realizations: that certain aspects of the Standard Model are fixed and inevitable, and certain aspects are not fixed and are therefore a source of confusion and a target for future research. Those twin aspects really inspired me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowns and unknowns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler spent three and a half years in Berkeley, California, after graduating from Harvard, working as a postdoc at the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California at Berkeley, and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which was just up the hill from the university. At the time, he was wrestling with whether to concentrate on the dynamics of behaviors that are known in the Standard Model, or explore phenemona beyond the Standard Model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was able to get a taste of both sides at Berkeley. On campus, he found that researchers tended to theorize about the more speculative, uncertain parts of the Standard Model, while researchers at the laboratory were looking in detail at more fixed phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would spend half my time on campus and half at the lab, and got the synthesis of the two, taking the shuttle bus up and down the hill,” Thaler says. “And sometimes the most exciting things are at the intersection of those two perspectives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, he applied for a faculty position at MIT and while interviewing got to talking with physics professor Richard Milner about ways to test for the existence of dark matter. From that conversation, Thaler proposed an experimental design, which has since evolved to become DarkLight, an MIT-led experiment that aims to look for “dark forces,” or interactions that are thought influence dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding structure within chaos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2010, Thaler moved, “in the dead of winter,” as he recalls, from Berkeley to Cambridge, as an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Physics. He expected a steep curve in learning how to juggle the various teaching and research responsibilities that come with being a professor. What he didn’t anticipate was how difficult it would be for him to hand over some of those responsibilities,\BC\B3&o\A0 particularly in research, to his students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Learning to let go and trust my students was eye-opening,” Thaler says. “The students at MIT are fantastically brilliant, and oftentiyles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/mit-energy-initiative-mitei-10-years-00_1.png" type="image" width="1320" height="880"><media:description type="plain">A look at 10 years of the MIT Energy Initiative, by the numbers</media:description><media:credit>Image: Jenn Schlick/MIT Energy Initiative</media:credit></media:content><story:tags>Energy, MIT Energy Initiative, Renewable energy, 3 Questions, Sustainability, Climate change, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E), School of Engineering, School of Science, School of Architecture and Planning, SHASS, Sloan School of Management</story:tags>  </item>  <item>    <title>Jesse Thaler: Seeking the fundamental nature of matter </title>    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/faculty-profile-jesse-thaler-1107</link>    <description>Theorist explores particle physics at the boundary of “messy and elegant.” </description>     <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate> <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News Office</dc:creator> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/faculty-profile-jesse-thaler-1107</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jesse Thaler was a high school student in 1995, when a pivotal discovery in science turned his life’s path toward particle physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That year, physicists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory confirmed that its Tevatron particle accelerator had detected, for the first time, a subatomic particle known as the top quark. This particle had been a missing piece in the Standard Model of particle physics — a theory that describes all the known elementary particles and several major, fundamental forces governing the universe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember my physics teacher had a big poster of the Standard Model on the wall, with a question mark next to the top quark,” says Thaler, who recently was granted tenure as an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Physics. “When it was discovered, I remember him writing down the mass of that top quark where there used to be a question mark. I thought discoveries must happen all the time. Little did I know that particle physics is a decades-long, even centuries-long, endeavor to try to understand the fundamental nature of matter, and that I would eventually become a part of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler, a member of MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics and the Laboratory for Nuclear Science, is a self-described “pencil and paper, chalk and chalkboard” theorist, and works to derive theoretical insights to characterize the behavior of subatomic particles, and the fundamental forces that give structure to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s applying his theories to describe in greater detail the particles that are already known to the Standard Model, as well as predict the behavior of those beyond the Standard Model, which scientific theory cannot quite yet describe — namely, dark matter, which is thought to make up more than a quarter of the total mass-energy of the universe but has yet to be directly detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler is collaborating with experimental physicists on projects ranging from small tabletop detectors to massive collaborations such as the Large Hadron Collider, and applying his theoretical insights to interpret data from current experiments and guide the design of future experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research is always a balance between exploring what could, but might not, be there, and what must be there,” Thaler says. “Some would say everything should be beautiful and elegant and mathematical, and others would say the world is messy; you just have to study it. But at this boundary, it’s true some things are messy, and others are elegant, and living at that boundary is where I feel most comfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Subtleties at play”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler grew up in York, Maine, where his mother worked as a high school guidance counselor, and his father practiced family medicine. For high school, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy, where he quickly learned to think his way through tricky mathematical problems on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There wasn’t a textbook,” Thaler recalls. “You showed up the first day, they gave you a relatively thin stack of problems, and you went to class and had discussions but basically had to teach yourself. It was a very humanities-minded way of thinking of mathematics, which could also apply to physics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler went on to Brown University, where he pursued a degree in math and physics, doing research into the formation of black holes, while also taking courses in the humanities, from Japanese theatre, to the role of women in Islamic society, to race relations in Brazilian history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those classes helped me see that there is nuance, even in cases where you think things might be clear-cut,” Thaler says. “In physics, there are similar types of subtleties at play, where you can take different views on the same problem, and the answer comes from the full synthesis of those views. I try to take that approach in the physics research I do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To blow off some academic steam, Thaler picked up the electric bass as part of an eight-piece ’70s funk band, and put in late-night hours at the college radio station, playing jazz records under the pseudonym Lester, after legendary jazz saxophonist Lester Young. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would spin vinyl from 2 to 5:30 a.m. and then would have my 9 a.m. quantum mechanics class,” Thaler fondly recalls. “It was rough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Brown, he went on to graduate school at Harvard University, with the intention of studying string theory, which at the time was thought to uniquely explain the synthesis of gravity and quantum mechanics, in one unifying theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now I know that to be not quite the right story,” Thaler says. “The modern view of string theory is not that there’s one theory of everything, but many different theories that come out of string theory, and it’s a challenge to figure out which one of those corresponds to our universe, if any. So there’s not inevitability built in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his second-semester quantum field theory course, Thaler’s professor, who would become his thesis advisor, helped him redirect his focus toward another theory, not of everything, but of almost everything: the Standard Model of particle physics. It was in this class that Thaler began to see this model as something that could predict, with 100 percent certainty, that many things in the universe, such as the universal strength of gravity, would always be true. He also started to appreciate that there were limits to the Standard Model, and that there are some things about the universe, such as dark matter, that the theory so far has failed to describe in any organized, mathematical way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This represented a totally new, flexible way of thinking of quantum field theory where you really poked and prodded it from all angles and figured out where it really breaks down,” Thaler says. “So you have these twin realizations: that certain aspects of the Standard Model are fixed and inevitable, and certain aspects are not fixed and are therefore a source of confusion and a target for future research. Those twin aspects really inspired me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowns and unknowns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler spent three and a half years in Berkeley, California, after graduating from Harvard, working as a postdoc at the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California at Berkeley, and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which was just up the hill from the university. At the time, he was wrestling with whether to concentrate on the dynamics of behaviors that are known in the Standard Model, or explore phenemona beyond the Standard Model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was able to get a taste of both sides at Berkeley. On campus, he found that researchers tended to theorize about the more speculative, uncertain parts of the Standard Model, while researchers at the laboratory were looking in detail at more fixed phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would spend half my time on campus and half at the lab, and got the synthesis of the two, taking the shuttle bus up and down the hill,” Thaler says. “And sometimes the most exciting things are at the intersection of those two perspectives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, he applied for a faculty position at MIT and while interviewing got to talking with physics professor Richard Milner about ways to test for the existence of dark matter. From that conversation, Thaler proposed an experimental design, which has since evolved to become DarkLight, an MIT-led experiment that aims to look for “dark forces,” or interactions that are thought influence dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding structure within chaos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2010, Thaler moved, “in the dead of winter,” as he recalls, from Berkeley to Cambridge, as an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Physics. He expected a steep curve in learning how to juggle the various teaching and research responsibilities that come with being a professor. What he didn’t anticipate was how difficult it would be for him to hand over some of those responsibilities,\BC\B3&o\A0mes I would have the wrong idea of how something sho00006000uld work. But my students have wonderfully stuck to their guns, even if I was skeptical of their results, and convinced me that they were right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Thaler’s research has made a major impact on several areas of physics, most notably on understanding the structure and behavior of jets produced from the collision of protons at high energies. Protons are made from accumulations of subatomic particles called quarks and gluons, which are held together by a glue-like interaction called the strong force. When protons collide at significant speeds, they release sprays or jets of quarks and gluons, which can rebind into collections of subatomic particles such as pions and kaons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaler has developed theoretical techniques to study the strong force and the structure of these jets in detail. His techniques are now being applied at the Large Hadron Collider — the largest, most powerful particle accelerator in the world, based in Geneva, Switzerland — to look for interesting physics, and even signs of dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studying these jets is a messy business,” Thaler says. “They look like they’re just chaos. But if you work your way up to the boundary of theoretical insights, you realize within that messiness, there’s structure, and you can exploit that structure to figure out what’s going on. We haven’t yet discovered dark matter in this way, but we have been able to search for it in more exquisite detail than in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, Thaler is eager to explore more uncharted territories beyond the Standard Model, and is working on theoretical designs for other experiments to detect dark matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a responsibility to push on whatever I think I can make an impact on, and push it forward,” Thaler says. “For that, I can’t think of a better place to be than MIT, for the next however many decades.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/MIT-Thaler-Jesse.jpg" type="image" width="948" height="632"><media:description type="plain">Professor Jesse Thaler, who recently was granted tenure as an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Physics, is applying his theoretical insights to interpret data from current experiments and guide the design of future experiments.</media:description><media:credit>Image: Jared Charney</media:credit></media:content><story:tags>Center for Theoretical Physics, Physics, Faculty, Profile, School of Science</story:tags>  </item>  <item>    <title>New techniques give blood biopsies greater promise</title>    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-techniques-give-blood-biopsies-greater-promise-1106</link>    <description>Improved methods validate the use of blood samples for studying patients’ cancer genomes.</description>     <pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 05:00:00 -0500</pubDate> <dc:creator>Broad Institute</dc:creator> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-techniques-give-blood-biopsies-greater-promise-1106</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital have developed an accurate, scalable approach for monitoring cancer DNA from blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporting in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the team demonstrates that nearly 90 percent of a tumor’s genetic features can be detected in blood samples using whole-exome sequencing, and that the method can be effectively applied in up to 49 percent of patients with advanced cancer — a number likely to increase as sequencing becomes cheaper. This less-invasive tumor sampling, which can provide a window into the cancer’s genome, has a range of potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our ultimate hope is to use blood biopsies to exhaustively search for and characterize even the smallest remnants of tumors,” explains Viktor Adalsteinsson, co-first author on the paper and group leader at the Broad Institute, where he leads the Blood Biopsy Team. “And, as tumors evolve in more advanced stages of cancer, developing resistance or becoming metastatic, we might access timepoints that could be pivotal in deciding which therapies are right for that patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability to detect and analyze cancer DNA from a patient’s blood sample is emerging as a promising alternative to invasive surgical biopsies, which can be difficult, painful, and costly — especially when tumors have appeared in locations that are challenging to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood biopsies (also called liquid biopsies) are poised to overcome many of these issues. They have the potential to allow doctors to track the progress of disease and treatment in real-time and to help researchers understand how tumors resist treatment with far greater resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding cancer without invasive procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells in the body, including tumor cells, regularly expel fragments of DNA into the bloodstream when they die. With blood biopsies, clinicians collect this “cell-free” DNA from a blood draw and then detect and comprehensively profile the fragments originating from cancer cells. Tracking these data could make it possible to monitor cancer recurrence, a patient’s response to treatment, and other clinically important features, all from blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research and development arena for blood biopsies is frequented by both academic and industry players, but with scalable whole-exome sequencing, a team led by Adalsteinsson and colleagues Gavin Ha, Sam Freeman, Matthew Meyerson, J. Christopher Love, and Gad Getz is taking the field in a new and innovative direction. Love is a Broad associate member, associate professor of chemical engineering at MIT, and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiling a whole exome from DNA fragments currently requires at least 10 percent tumor DNA in a blood sample, but the fraction of tumor DNA in the blood can vary wildly from patient to patient. Because of this variation, the team first desired an unbiased approach for detecting and measuring levels of cancer DNA before attempting whole-exome sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the field, many blood biopsy methods detect tumor DNA by screening for mutations in known cancer-related genes, but this targeted sequencing misses cancers without those mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-first author Ha, a postdoc at the Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), led the development of a tool called ichorCNA that can analyze DNA fragments for mutation patterns nearly universal in cancer genomes, and as a result capture cancers with both known and unknown mutations. Ha focused on detecting stretches of DNA that have either fewer or greater copies in cancer cells, in contrast to healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested and refined ichorCNA on 1,439 blood samples collected prospectively from 520 metastatic breast or prostate cancer patients at DFCI (a significant effort championed by medical oncologists Atish Choudhury, Daniel Stover, Heather Parsons, Nikhil Wagle, and colleagues).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, the researchers found that in 33 to 49 percent of the metastatic breast and prostate cancer patients, depending upon whether one or multiple blood samples were examined, tumor DNA made up greater than 10 percent of the cell-free DNA in their blood — enough to make whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, to determine whether this sequencing of cell-free tumor DNA could offer the same level of insight into cancer genetics as a tissue biopsy could, the team compared surgically obtained tumor biopsies to data collected from whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA from a group of 41 patients. The researchers found that genetic data from blood whole-exome sequencing and tissue biopsies matched significantly across a number of genetic features, such as clonal somatic mutations (88 percent match) and copy number alterations (80 percent match).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results support cell-free DNA whole-exome sequencing, from blood samples, as a potential substitute for metastatic tumor biopsy sequencing for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study has demonstrated that we can get a cancer whole exome reliably, from blood; that it reflects the matched tumor biopsy; and that it can be done for a significant fraction of patients with metastatic cancer,” says Adalsteinsson, who was a postdoc in Love’s lab before joining the Broad Institute. “This validation suggests that we can use blood biopsies for large-scale genomic characterization of disease in patients with metastatic cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It unlocks the potential for a lot of studies that we couldn’t do before,” adds Getz, institute member and director of the Cancer Genome Computational Analysis group at Broad and associate professor of Pathology and director of Bioinformatics at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Department of Pathology. “The technology will allow us to track the dynamics of cancer and understand the evolution of drug resistance, or the development of the metastatic state, in a way that isn’t possible through surgical biopsies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study improves the analysis pipeline for blood biopsies and allows it to be performed at expanded scale. Th\BC\B3&o\A0e researchers are actively applying their work to thousands of patients with metastatic cancer who may otherwise not have their tumors biopsied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this work, we now have a framework for th;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Thaler’s research has made a major impact on several areas of physics, most notably on understanding the structure and behavior of jets produced from the collision of protons at high energies.

Scientists and engineers could enter the name of a target material and any other criteria — precursor materials, reaction conditions, fabrication processes — and pull up suggested recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a step toward realizing that vision, Olivetti and her colleagues have developed a machine-learning system that can analyze a research paper, deduce which of its paragraphs contain materials recipes, and classify the words in those paragraphs according to their roles within the recipes: names of target materials, numeric quantities, names of pieces of equipment, operating conditions, descriptive adjectives, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper appearing in the latest issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;Chemistry of Materials&lt;/em&gt;, they also demonstrate that a machine-learning system can analyze the extracted data to infer general characteristics of classes of materials — such as the different temperature ranges that their synthesis requires — or particular characteristics of individual materials — such as the different physical forms they will take when their fabrication conditions vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivetti is the senior author on the paper, and she’s joined by Edward Kim, an MIT graduate student in DMSE; Kevin Huang, a DMSE postdoc; Adam Saunders and Andrew McCallum, computer scientists at UMass Amherst; and Gerbrand Ceder, a Chancellor’s Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling in the gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained their system using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques. “Supervised” means that the training data fed to the system is first annotated by humans; the system tries to find correlations between the raw data and the annotations. “Unsupervised” means that the training data is unannotated, and the system instead learns to cluster data together according to structural similarities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because materials-recipe extraction is a new area of research, Olivetti and her colleagues didn’t have the luxury of large, annotated data sets accumulated over years by diverse teams of researchers. Instead, they had to annotate their data themselves — ultimately, about 100 papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By machine-learning standards, that’s a pretty small data set. To improve it, they used an algorithm developed at Google called Word2vec. Word2vec looks at the contexts in which words occur — the words’ syntactic roles within sentences and the other words around them — and groups together words that tend to have similar contexts. So, for instance, if one paper contained the sentence “We heated the titanium tetracholoride to 500 C,” and another contained the sentence “The sodium hydroxide was heated to 500 C,” Word2vec would group “titanium tetracholoride” and “sodium hydroxide” together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Word2vec, the researchers were able to greatly expand their training set, since the machine-learning system could infer that a label attached to any given word was likely to apply to other words clustered with it. Instead of 100 papers, the researchers could thus train their system on around 640,000 papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip of the iceberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the system’s accuracy, however, they had to rely on the labeled data, since they had no criterion for evaluating its performance on the unlabeled data. In those tests, the system was able to identify with 99 percent accuracy the paragraphs that contained recipes and to label with 86 percent accuracy the words within those paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that further work will improve the system’s accuracy, and in ongoing work they are exploring a battery of deep learning techniques that can make further generalizations about the structure of materials recipes, with the goal of automatically devising recipes for materials not considered in the existing literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Olivetti’s prior resear\BC\B3&o\A0ch has concentrated on finding more cost-effective and environmentally responsible ways to produce useful materials, and she hopes that a database of materials recipes could abet that project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\E2gy at DFCI and Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method is already in use with patients for cancer research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the back of the team’s success, ichorCNA and subsequent whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA have been incorporated into a collaboration with the Broad Institute Genomics Platform to enable comprehensive mapping of metastatic and drug-resistant tumors from blood samples at scale. This approach has also been integrated into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/node/129806/&quot;&gt;direct-to-patient research efforts&lt;/a&gt; underway at Broad, including the Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Project, a patient outreach effort that collects saliva and tissue samples — and now blood samples — donated from metastatic breast cancer patients for DNA sequencing to further therapeutic research.

Phillips told researchers who gathered for&amp;nbsp;the annual MIT Materials Research Laboratory (MRL)&amp;nbsp;Materials Day Symposium last month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is both very exciting for us as materials researchers, also a little frustrating, is that the real impact of materials occurs when they turn into something that you actually carry around in your pocket or whatever,” Phillips said at the Oct. 11 event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the second half of the 20th century, many of the technological advances that we take for granted today, such as laptop computers and smart phones, came from fundamental advances in materials research and the ability to control and make materials, she said.

In his introductory remarks, MRL Director Carl V. Thompson noted&amp;nbsp;the appointment of Geoffrey S.D. Beach, an associate professor of materials science and engineering&amp;nbsp; as co-director of the MRL and principal investigator for the National Science Foundation Materials Research Science and Engineering Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fueled by industrial needs00006000 and government-funded research in the post-World War II era, “materials research was undeniably an early model for interdisciplinary research,” Phillips said. With new tools such as scanning probe microscopes to understand the structure and properties of materials, materials scientists in the last half of the 20th century created whole new classes of materials and products, ranging from super alloys that enabled larger and more reliable jet engines to strained layer superlattices that underlie modern magnetic recording,&amp;nbsp;lasers, and infrared detectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future gains will come from the ability to synthesize and control increasingly complex materials, Phillips said, noting progress in areas such as high-temperature superconductors, porous solids like metal organic frameworks, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/subjects/metamaterials&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;metamaterials&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that generate new properties from combining biological materials, organics, ceramic, and metals at near molecular scale precision in ways not found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Somewhere in the fuzzy space between molecules and materials,”&amp;nbsp;these newer materials have very interesting properties that are still in the process of being fully explored, and they will be exploited in the years to come, &amp;nbsp;Phillips noted. “It’s very clear to many people that these also will be transformational as we move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The materials research approach, which brings together researchers from across different science and engineering fields to solve complex problems, provides a model for solving 21st century challenges in energy, environment and sustainability; health care and medicine; vulnerability to human and natural threats; and expanding and enhancing human capability and joy. “These are exemplars, but you can see materials written all over this list, and I would posit that any comparable list you might come up with would have materials written all over it,” Phillips said. “In order to address those grand challenges, we really need to be able to treat realistically complex systems that bring together all of these disciplines from the sciences, from engineering, from the social and behavioral sciences, and arguably even from the arts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress in scientific understanding and computational modeling are accelerating researchers’ ability to predict the structure and properties of new materials before actually making them, Phillips said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT faculty members Antoine Allanore, Polina Anikeeva, A. John Hart, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, Juejun Hu, and Jennifer Rupp presented research updates on their recent work which spans a range from ultra-thin layered materials for new electronic devices and cellular level probes for the brain and spinal cord to larger scale methods for 3D printing and metals processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merging 2-D materials with CMOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate professor of physics&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/jarillo-herrero_pablo.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pablo Jarillo-Herrero&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;stacks atomically thin, two-dimensional&amp;nbsp;layers of different materials to discover new properties. Jarillo-Herrero’s lab demonstrated photodetectors, solar cells and the world’s thinnest LED. With materials such as tungsten selenide, changing the number of layers also changes their electronic properties. Although graphene itself has no bandgap, closely aligning the lattices of graphene and boron nitride opens a 30-millivolt bandgap in graphene, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have full electronic control with gate voltages,” Jarillo-Herrero said. Using bilayer molybdenum ditelluride, which is 10,000 times thinner than a silicon solar cell, he showed in work published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt;, a photodetector just 10 nanometers thick can be integrated on a silicon photonic crystal waveguide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You can just stack this at the very end of your CMOS [complementary metal oxide semiconductor] processing, and you don’t have to do any extra fabrication, any extra growth, you can just slap it on top,” Jarillo-Herrero explained. “It can be made as thin as 4 nanometers, so it’s still ultra thin, and you have a high degree of control in an ultra thin platform. The whole thing is semitransparent so we can see the light go in and out.” These new devices can be operated at telecommunications wavelengths by tuning the bandgap of the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase change materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/profile/hu&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juejun &quot;JJ&quot; Hu&lt;/a&gt;, the Merton C. Flemings Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, is reducing power consumption, shrinking device size, and ramping up processing speed with innovative combinations of materials that alternate between two different solid states, or phases, such as an alloy of germanium, antimony, selenium, and tellurium. These materials are the basis for nonvolatile storage, meaning their memory state is preserved even when the power is turned off. Hu collaborated with Professor Jeffrey C. Grossman and former postdoc Huashan Li to identify desirable materials for these alloys from first principles calculations, and graduate materials science an\BC\B3&o\A0d engineering student Yifei Zhang did much of the experied and Linda R.

With new tools such as scanning probe microscopes to understand the structure and properties of materials, materials scientists in the last half of the 20th century created whole new classes of materials and products, ranging from super alloys that enabled larger and more reliable jet engines to strained layer superlattices that underlie modern magnetic recording,&amp;nbsp;lasers, and infrared detectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future gains will come from the ability to synthesize and control increasingly complex materials, Phillips said, noting progress in areas such as high-temperature superconductors, porous solids like metal organic frameworks, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/subjects/metamaterials&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;metamaterials&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that generate new properties from combining biological materials, organics, ceramic, and metals at near molecular scale precision in ways not found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Somewhere in the fuzzy space between molecules and materials,”&amp;nbsp;these newer materials have very interesting properties that are still in the process of being fully explored, and they will be exploited in the years to come, &amp;nbsp;Phillips noted. “It’s very clear to many people that these also will be transformational as we move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The materials research approach, which brings together researchers from across different science and engineering fields to solve complex problems, provides a model for solving 21st century challenges in energy, environment and sustainability; health care and medicine; vulnerability to human and natural threats; and expanding and enhancing human capability and joy. “These are exemplars, but you can see materials written all over this list, and I would posit that any comparable list you might come up with would have materials written all over it,” Phillips said. “In order to address those grand challenges, we really need to be able to treat realistically complex systems that bring together all of these disciplines from the sciences, from engineering, from the social and behavioral sciences, and arguably even from the arts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress in scientific understanding and computational modeling are accelerating researchers’ ability to predict the structure and properties of new materials before actually making them, Phillips said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT faculty members Antoine Allanore, Polina Anikeeva, A. John Hart, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, Juejun Hu, and Jennifer Rupp presented research updates on their recent work which spans a range from ultra-thin layered materials for new electronic devices and cellular level probes for the brain and spinal cord to larger scale methods for 3D printing and metals processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merging 2-D materials with CMOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate professor of physics&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/jarillo-herrero_pablo.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pablo Jarillo-Herrero&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;stacks atomically thin, two-dimensional&amp;nbsp;layers of different materials to discover new properties. Jarillo-Herrero’s lab demonstrated photodetectors, solar cells and the world’s thinnest LED. With materials such as tungsten selenide, changing the number of layers also changes their electronic properties. Although graphene itself has no bandgap, closely aligning the lattices of graphene and boron nitride opens a 30-millivolt bandgap in graphene, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have full electronic control with gate voltages,” Jarillo-Herrero said. Using bilayer molybdenum ditelluride, which is 10,000 times thinner than a silicon solar cell, he showed in work published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt;, a photodetector just 10 nanometers thick can be integrated on a silicon photonic crystal waveguide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You can just stack this at the very end of your CMOS [complementary metal oxide semiconductor] processing, and you don’t have to do any extra fabrication, any extra growth, you can just slap it on top,” Jarillo-Herrero explained. “It can be made as thin as 4 nanometers, so it’s still ultra thin, and you have a high degree of control in an ultra thin platform. The whole thing is semitransparent so we can see the light go in and out.” These new devices can be operated at telecommunications wavelengths by tuning the bandgap of the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase change materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/profile/hu&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juejun &quot;JJ&quot; Hu&lt;/a&gt;, the Merton C. Flemings Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, is reducing power consumption, shrinking device size, and ramping up processing speed with innovative combinations of materials that alternate between two different solid states, or phases, such as an alloy of germanium, antimony, selenium, and tellurium. These materials are the basis for nonvolatile storage, meaning their memory state is preserved even when the power is turned off. Hu collaborated with Professor Jeffrey C. Grossman and former postdoc Huashan Li to identify desirable materials for these alloys from first principles calculations, and graduate materials science anmental work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier generation of devices based on germanium, antimony, and tellurium (GST) suffers from losses to light absorption by the material. To overcome this problem, Hu substituted some of the tellurium with a lighter element, selenium, creating a new four-element structure of germanium, antimony, selenium and tellurium (GSST). “We increase the bandgap to suppress short wavelength absorption, and we actually minimize any carrier mobility to mitigate the free carrier absorption,” he explained. Switching between amorphous and crystalline states can be triggered with a laser pulse or an electrical signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the structural state switching happens on the order of 100 nanoseconds, figuring out the techniques to accomplish it took a year of work, Hu said. Specifically, he found that using materials that switch between amorphous and crystalline states allows light to be directed over two different paths and reduces power consumption. He coupled this GSST optical phase change material with silicon nitride microresonators and waveguides to show this behavior. These switches based on phase change materials can be connected in a matrix to enable variable light control on a chip. Ultimately, Hu hopes to use this technology to build re-programmable photonic integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New tools for brain exploration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Class of 1942 Associate Professor in Materials Science and Engineering&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/profile/anikeeva&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polina Anikeeva&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;works at the border between synthetic devices and the nervous system. Traditional electronic devices, with hardness like a knife, can trigger a foreign-body response from brain tissue, which typically is as soft as pudding or yogurt. Working with Prof. Yoel Fink and other MIT colleagues, Anikeeva developed soft polymer-based devices to stimulate and record activity of brain and spinal cord tissue borrowing from optical fiber drawing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early version of their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2015/fibers-deliver-simultaneous-stimuli-0119&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;multi-functional fibers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;included three key elements: conductive polyethylene carbon composite electrodes to record brain cell activity; a transparent polycarbonate waveguide with cyclic olefin copolymer cladding to deliver light; and microfluidic channels to deliver drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using this structure, for the first time, we were able to record, stimulate and pharmacologically modulate neural activity,” Anikeeva said. But the device recorded activity from clusters of neurons, not individual neurons. Anikeeva and her team addressed this problem by integrating graphite into the polyethylene composite electrodes, which increased their conductivity enough to shrink them into a structure that is as thin as a human hair. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/multifunctional-tiny-fibers-brain-0221&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;device&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has six electrodes, an optical waveguide and two microfluidic channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet adding graphite increased the size and hardness of the glassy polycarbonate device, so her group turned to a new process using rubbery, stretchy polymers that they then coated with a conductive metal nanowire mesh. “This mesh of conductive metal nanowires can maintain low impedance even at 100 percent strain, and it maintains its structural integrity without any changes up to 20 percent strain, which is sufficient for us to operate in the spinal cord,” Anikeeva said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her students implanted these&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/stretching-boundaries-neural-implants-0331&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;nanowire-mesh coated fibers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in mice, which allowed them to stimulate and record neural activity in the spinal cord. A video showed a mouse moving its hindlimb when an optical signal delivered to the lumbar spinal cord traveled down the sciatic nerve to the gastrocnemius muscle. In these experiments, the device implanted in mice showed ated whole new classes of materials and products, ranging from super alloys that enabled larger and more reliable jet engines to strained layer superlattices that underlie modern magnetic recording,&amp;nbsp;lasers, and infrared detectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future gains will come from the ability to synthesize and control increasingly complex materials, Phillips said, noting progress in areas such as high-temperature superconductors, porous solids like metal organic frameworks, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/subjects/metamaterials&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;metamaterials&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that generate new properties from combining biological materials, organics, ceramic, and metals at near molecular scale precision in ways not found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Somewhere in the fuzzy space between molecules and materials,”&amp;nbsp;these newer materials have very interesting properties that are still in the process of being fully explored, and they will be exploited in the years to come, &amp;nbsp;Phillips noted. “It’s very clear to many people that these also will be transformational as we move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The materials research approach, which brings together researchers from across different science and engineering fields to solve complex problems, provides a model for solving 21st century challenges in energy, environment and sustainability; health care and medicine; vulnerability to human and natural threats; and expanding and enhancing human capability and joy. “These are exemplars, but you can see materials written all over this list, and I would posit that any comparable list you might come up with would have materials written all over it,” Phillips said. “In order to address those grand challenges, we really need to be able to treat realistically complex systems that bring together all of these disciplines from the sciences, from engineering, from the social and behavioral sciences, and arguably even from the arts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress in scientific understanding and computational modeling are accelerating researchers’ ability to predict the structure and properties of new materials before actually making them, Phillips said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT faculty members Antoine Allanore, Polina Anikeeva, A.

Experimenting with mice, Anikeeva injected these tiny particles deep in the brain in a section that is associated with reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our lab, we have started by modeling hysteresis in magnetic nanoparticles, synthesizing a broad range of these nanomaterials by engineering iron oxide with dopants and looking at different sizes and shapes, developing power electronics and a biological tool kit to assess this process,” Anikeeva explained. “In this case, there is no external hardwire, no wires, no implants, nothing is sticking out of the brain. … However, they can now perceive magnetic field.” she said. To quantify their results, the researchers measured&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2015/magnetic-brain-stimulation-0312&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;calcium ion influx into neurons&lt;/a&gt;.

M. Rupp&lt;/a&gt;, the Thomas Lord Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, presented research showing a solid lithium garnet electrolyte can lead to batteries miniaturized on an integrated circuit chip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety concerns regarding lithium batteries stem from their liquid component, which serves as the electrolyte and presents a risk of catching fire in air. Replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid one could make batteries safer, Rupp explained. Her research shows that a ceramic material made of garnet, a material that is perhaps more familiar as a gemstone, can effectively pass lithium through a battery cell, but because it is solid, can be very safe for batteries and also have the opportunity to be miniaturized to thin film architectures. This garnet is a four-element compound of lithium, lanthanum, zirconium and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lithium is completely encapsulated; there is no risk of inflammation,” Rupp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aenm.201600736&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published research&lt;/a&gt;, Rupp showed that pairing a lithium titanium oxide anode with a ceramic garnet electrolyte and blurring the interface between the two materials allowed much faster battery charging time for large-scale cells. Lessons learned from applying these garnet materials pointed also to a new use for carbon dioxide sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can reconfigure the electrodes to have one electrode which simply goes as a reference, and another which undergoes a chemical reaction with carbon dioxide, and we use a tracker potential to track the effective change of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment based on bulk processing,” she explained. Rupp is also developing strained multi-layer materials to improve storage for memristive memory and computing elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontier for metals at high temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor of Metallurgy&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/profile/allanore&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antoine Allanore&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;pointed out that from 1980 to 2010, the world almost doubled its consumption of materials, with the fastest growth in metals and minerals. Such demand is due to the formidable low cost and high productivity of materials processing. The majority of such processes involve at some stage a high temperature operation and often the molten state of matter. Developing the science and engineering of the molten state brings huge opportunities, for example heat management in high-temperature processes such as metals extraction and glass making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steelmaking, for example, is already a highly efficient manufacturing process, turning out rebar, coil or wires of steel at a cost less than 32 cents per kilogram. “Productivity is actually the key criteria to make materials processing successful and matter at the scale of the challenge of adding 2 billion people in the next 20 years,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allanore’s group demonstrated that tin sulfide at high temperature, about 1,130 degrees Celsius, is an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://mpc-www.mit.edu/component/k2/item/5983&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;effective thermoelectric generator&lt;/a&gt;. “We have indications that the theoretical figure of merit for some sulfides, can be up to 1 at 1,130 [degrees Celsius]. For molten copper sulfide for example, we have estimates of the thermal conductivity, the melting point, and we have a cost that is a little bit high in my opinion, but that’s the nature of the research,” Allanore said. When his group looked at existing data, they found that for many molten compounds of sulfur and a metal, such as tin, lead or nickel, the thermoelectric figure of merit, as well as the compositional phases, had never been quantified, opening a frontier for new materials science research at high temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s actually very difficult to know what are the true properties of the liquid,” Allanore said. “I need to know if that material will have semiconductivity. I need to know if it’s going to be denser or lighter than another liquid. … We don’t actually have computational methods to predict such property for liquids at high temperature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the problem, Allanore studied the relation in high-temperature melts between transport properties, including electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficients, and a thermodynamic property called entropy. “We’ve put together a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;https://mpc-www.mit.edu/component/k2/item/5984&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theoretical model&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that connects the transport property, like thermal power, and the thermodynamic property like entropy. This is important because it works for semiconductors, it works for metallic materials and more importantly it allows to find out regions of immiscibility in liquids,” Allanore said.&amp;nbsp;Immiscibility means a material in the given condition will separate into two phases that do not mix together and remain separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allanore has also developed a new method for observing molten compounds such as alumina, using a floating zone furnace, which is a transparent quartz tube located at the focal distance of four lamps. “If we can do that with oxides, we would really like to do that with sulfides,” he explained, showing a picture of molten tin sulfide sitting on a graphite plate in the floating zone furnace. The wide range of temperatures and properties of molten materials, “the ultimate state of condensed matter”, allows for better heat management, higher processing temperatures and electricity harvesting or electrical control of heat flow, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-D printing a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;manufacturing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional manufacturing requires economies of scale, in particular, large production volumes because of the fixed costs necessary to set up the production process, but 3-D printing and other additive manufacturing technologies offer an alternative of high-performance, customizable products and devices, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/ajhart@mit.edu&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A. John Hart&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additive manufacturing is already a $6 billion a year business with reach from Hollywood special effects to high-tech jet engine nozzles. “Additive manufacturing already enables a diverse collection of materials, applications, and related processes – including by extrusion of plastics, melting metals, using lasers, and by coordinated chemical reactions that essentially are done with point wise control,” Hart explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can think of accessing new spaces in terms of the value of the products we create using additive manufacturing, also generally known as 3-D printing. 3-D printing is reshaping the axes by which we judge the economic viability of a manufacturing process, and allowing us to access new value spaces. For instance, we can think not only about production volume, but think about advantages in complexity of geometries, and advantages by customization of products to specific markets or even individuals. In these ways, 3-D printing is influencing the entire product life cycle,” Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Hart’s group&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2017.03.007&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studied existing 3-D printers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to discover how to speed up the process from about 60 minutes to just 5 to 10 minutes to print a handheld mechanical part such as a gear. Former graduate student Jamison Go, SM &#039;15&amp;nbsp;led this work, Hart said, building a e from neurons in the brain that express ion channels that are sensitive to heat such as capsaicin receptor, the same mechanism that is triggered when we eat hot peppers.

I need to know if it’s going to be denser or lighter than another liquid. … We don’t actually have computational methods to predict such property for liquids at high temperature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the problem, Allanore studied the relation in high-temperature melts between transport properties, including electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficients, and a thermodynamic property called entropy. “We’ve put together a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;https://mpc-www.mit.edu/component/k2/item/5984&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theoretical model&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that connects the transport property, like thermal power, and the thermodynamic property like entropy. This is important because it works for semiconductors, it works for metallic materials and more importantly it allows to find out regions of immiscibility in liquids,” Allanore said.&amp;nbsp;Immiscibility means a material in the given condition will separate into two phases that do not mix together and remain separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allanore has also developed a new method for observing molten compounds such as alumina, using a floating zone furnace, which is a transparent quartz tube located at the focal distance of four lamps. “If we can do that with oxides, we would really like to do that with sulfides,” he explained, showing a picture of molten tin sulfide sitting on a graphite plate in the floating zone furnace. The wide range of temperatures and properties of molten materials, “the ultimate state of condensed matter”, allows for better heat management, higher processing temperatures and electricity harvesting or electrical control of heat flow, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-D printing a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;manufacturing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional manufacturing requires economies of scale, in particular, large production volumes because of the fixed costs necessary to set up the production process, but 3-D printing and other additive manufacturing technologies offer an alternative of high-performance, customizable products and devices, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/ajhart@mit.edu&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A. John Hart&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additive manufacturing is already a $6 billion a year business with reach from Hollywood special effects to high-tech jet engine nozzles. “Additive manufacturing already enables a diverse collection of materials, applications, and related processes – including by extrusion of plastics, melting metals, using lasers, and by coordinated chemical reactions that essentially are done with point wise control,” Hart explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can think of accessing new spaces in terms of the value of the products we create using additive manufacturing, also generally known as 3-D printing. 3-D printing is reshaping the axes by which we judge the economic viability of a manufacturing process, and allowing us to access new value spaces. For instance, we can think not only about production volume, but think about advantages in complexity of geometries, and advantages by customization of products to specific markets or even individuals. In these ways, 3-D printing is influencing the entire product life cycle,” Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Hart’s group&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2017.03.007&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studied existing 3-D printers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to discover \BC\B3&o\A0desktop 3-D printer about the size of a small microwave oven. The system features a control system for the printhead that moves the motors to the corner; an extrusion mechanism that drives the feedstock polymer filament like a screw; and a laser that penetrates and melts the polymer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By combining the fast motion control, the high heat transfer, and the high force, we can overcome the limits of the existing system,” Hart explained. The new design is three to 10 times faster in build rate than existing machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These kinds of steps forward can also change how we think about producing objects. If you can make something fast, you can think about how you might, or how others might, work differently,” he said. He mentioned, for instance, physicians who may need to 3-D print a part for an emergency medical operation, or a repair technician who could use a 3-D printer rather than hold inventory of many spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart’s group is currently working in collaboration with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ornl.gov&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oak Ridge National Lab&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on algorithms for optimization of 3-D printing toolpaths, and adapting his innovations to large-scale 3-D&amp;nbsp;printers. “We can think about upscaling these principles to high productivity systems that are not only printing small things but printing big things,” Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart has also worked with 3-D printing of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a dir=&quot;ltr&quot; href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/3-d-printing-cellulose-0303&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cellulose&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used for customization of consumer products and antimicrobial devices, and is the world’s most abundant natural polymer. He co-founded the company Desktop Metal with three other MIT faculty members and Ric Fulop, SL ’06, who serves as Desktop Metal’s CEO. “The company is only two years old and will soon ship its first product which enables an entirely new approach to metal 3-D printing,” Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><media:content url="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2017/Materials-Day-2017-Polina-Anikeev-MIT-00.png" type="image" width="1080" height="720"><media:description type="plain">New tools for brain exploration: Class of 1942 Associate Professor in Materials Science and Engineering Polina Anikeeva and colleagues developed soft polymer-based devices to stimulate and record activity of brain and and spinal cord tissue.</media:description><media:credit> Photo: Denis Paiste/MIT MRL</media:credit></media:content><story:tags>3-D printing, Batteries, DMSE, Materials Science and Engineering, School of Engineering, Materials Research Laboratory, Special events and guest speakers</story:tags>  </item>  <item>    <title>Why we should welcome warnings</title>    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/starr-forum-welcome-warnings-1103</link>    <description>At MIT event, experts call for a new approach to worst-case scenarios.</description>     <pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office</dc:creator> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/starr-forum-welcome-warnings-1103</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nuclear accidents. Sea level rise. Terror threats. The world is full of potential catastrophes, but most of the time, most of us are oblivious to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, at times, experts warn the rest of us about these potential crises. Sometimes those warnings work, but many times they go unheeded. Why do we ignore information we could use to stave off a disaster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prominent national security expert Richard Clarke SM ’79 weighed in on this issue at MIT’s la00001C67test Starr Forum event on Wednesday, making the case that we should be more receptive to the possibility of dire news, as well as more systematic about analyzing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarke, the former chief counter-terrorism advisor on the National Security Council, expanded on ideas in his new book, “Warnings,” asserting that specialists in a range of fields can “see the thing buried in the data that other people don’t see. They see it first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarke called these people “Cassandras,” after the figure in Greek mythology who could see the future, and described them as experts with accumulated knowledge and a willingness to explore worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just can’t be any old person off the street saying the sky is falling,” Clarke said. “It&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;has to be a recognized, acknowledged expert in the field they were giving the warning in. … They had to have studied it and been data-driven.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prove me wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples of this dynamic abound. Engineers warned that Japan’s nuclear power industry was vulnerable to natural disasters well before the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami of 2011. Experts stated that New Orleans was vulnerable to flooding before Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. Climate scientists, for decades, have warned the world that global warming could upend life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Clarke, for his part, gained a significant public profile after being one of the U.S. security officials most concerned about the threat of the al Qaeda terror group before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But plenty of dire-sounding warnings can also be unfounded and ultimately incorrect. So how can leaders — in government, business, or elsewhere — distinguish between legitimate fears and simplistic scare-mongering?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Clarke, a person with a legitimate warning to offer will be willing to have their ideas tested by others: “Cassandras repeatedly say, ‘Well, I gave my data to other experts in the field and said, prove me wrong, and none of them could. They could never prove my data wrong.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not act?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if experts are often raising concerns, why do those warnings get ignored? Clarke emphasized that being quick to recognize concerns produces its own set of problems, starting with a lack of consensus. When experts are “yelling to a decison maker, ‘There’s a problem,’ the decision maker says, ‘Yeah? Who else believes you? What other experts in the field agree?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then too, Clarke said, data-based concerns over catastrophes can be ignored due to what he calls “first occurrence syndrome,” namely, the fact that many potential problems have “never happened before, in the memory of the people involved.” New Orleans, for example, had never previously flooded to the degree that it did due to Hurricane Katrina. It is easier to imagine that history will continue within its recent bounds. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Clarke noted, there can be a “diffusion of accountability” in organizations. One data scientist repeatedly told the firm Equifax recently that it was vulnerable to being hacked, he said. But the responsibility for acting on that was essentially distributed among several people — which can lead to institutional inertia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Clarke added, to stave off disaster, especially in matters related to climate change, “You might have to do something ideologically abhorrent to you. You might have to raise taxes or try carbon capture or enact regulations.” Thus solutions mean to pre-empt catastrophes of all kinds can languish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the sea rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Starr Forum consists of a series of public discussions, sponsored by MIT’s Center for International Studies, focused on global security issues and other matters of international politics. About 125 people attended the event Wednesday, which was open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarke’s remarks were followed by a dialogue with counterintelligence expert and Center for International Studies Fellow Joel Brenner, as well as a question-and-answer session with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Clarke observed that being a “Cassandra” can take a heavy psychological toll on experts who find their ideas marginalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these people get agitated when they are ignored,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brenner largely concurred, but wryly noted that “a lot of these people have a special talent for burning bridges” within the organizations they are serving. Still, Brenner noted, the complications of contemporary society and technology mean it is generally safe to assume, at any given time, that “something is going seriously wrong somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to produce a hierarchy of issues for us to worry about, Clarke emphasized the vast problems that sea level rise, as a product of climate change, could create in the decades ahead. Rather than the consensus estimate of 3 meters of sea level rise by the year 2100, Clarke stated, we could see 6 to 9 meters of sea level rise by 2050 or 2075.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Think about the economic, political, social implications of that,” Clarke said. “Some countries diappear. Mass migrations of people.” He also cited the potential for economic “collapse” in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Clarke did try to inject some hope into the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe in good government’s ability to be rational and save the world from some of these disasters,” Clarke said, adding: “I think it’s an optimistic book, because itoven.
